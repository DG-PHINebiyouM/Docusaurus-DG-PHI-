# 3.1 EPMS Overview and Capabilities


The **Electricity & Power Monitoring System** (EPMS) provides real-time monitoring, analysis, and visualization of the facility's power distribution infrastructure. It offers system administrators visibility into power quality, consumption patterns, load profiles, and electrical system health across multiple building areas and equipment types. **EPMS** provides monitoring of key electrical points such as voltage, current, power, and energy consumption for the entire facility's power distribution infrastructure from medium voltage equipment all the way down to distribution boards and critical loads.
