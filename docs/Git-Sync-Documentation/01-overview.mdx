# Git Sync Overview

## What is Git Sync?

Git Sync is a powerful CLI tool designed to synchronize files and directories across multiple repositories with advanced features like:

- Automatic file synchronization
- Configurable sync intervals
- GitHub App authentication
- Symlink-based file management
- Robust error handling and recovery

> **Info** ðŸ’¡
> 
> Git Sync is particularly useful for:
> - Keeping configuration files in sync across multiple repositories
> - Maintaining consistent configurations across different environments
> - Automated file distribution and management

## Key Features

- **Flexible Configuration**: Use YAML-based configuration with Go template support
- **Multiple Repository Support**: Sync files from multiple repositories simultaneously
- **Authentication**: Secure GitHub App authentication
- **Health Monitoring**: Built-in health check and monitoring endpoints
- **Resilient Sync Mechanism**: Advanced error recovery and retry strategies

## Use Cases

1. **Configuration Management**
   - Sync configuration files across development, staging, and production environments
   - Centralize configuration management

2. **Cross-Repository Synchronization**
   - Keep shared resources in sync across different repositories
   - Automate file distribution

3. **Infrastructure as Code**
   - Maintain consistent infrastructure configurations
   - Automate updates across multiple projects

## Quick Example

```yaml
# Example configuration
syncs:
- repo: https://github.com/your-org/config-repo.git
  branch: main
  push_branch: sync-configs
  sync_interval: 30s
  destinations:
  - target: ./app/config/production.yaml
    source: configs/production.yaml
