## Overview

Git Sync provides robust health monitoring capabilities to track system status, sync performance, and repository health.

## Health Endpoints

### Available Endpoints

1. `/health`
   - Overall system health status
   - Detailed sync state for each repository

2. `/readiness`
   - Indicates if the application is ready to receive traffic

3. `/liveness`
   - Confirms the application is running

4. `/metrics`
   - Detailed performance and status metrics

## Health Status Types

```go
type Status int32

const (
    StatusStarting Status = iota
    StatusHealthy
    StatusUnhealthy
    StatusUnknown
)
Sync State Tracking
Each repository's sync state is comprehensively tracked:

go
Copy code
type SyncState struct {
    Repo          string
    Branch        string
    LastSync      time.Time
    LastError     string
    Status        string
    SyncCount     int64
    ErrorCount    int64
    PendingBranch string
}
Health Response Example
json
Copy code
{
    "status": "healthy",
    "timestamp": "2023-06-15T10:30:45Z",
    "uptime": "2h34m",
    "syncStates": {
        "https://github.com/org/repo1:main": {
            "status": "healthy",
            "lastSync": "2023-06-15T10:30:00Z",
            "syncCount": 42
        }
    }
}
Monitoring Strategies
Periodic Health Checks
Automatic internal health assessments
Configurable check intervals
Immediate status updates
Sync Performance Tracking
Track sync duration
Monitor error rates
Identify slow or problematic repositories
Configuration Options
yaml
Copy code
health_monitoring:
  enabled: true
  check_interval: 30s
  detailed_metrics: true
Key Metrics Tracked
Total sync operations
Successful vs. failed syncs
Average sync duration
Repository-specific error rates
Integration Considerations
Tip üí°

Use health endpoints with monitoring systems
Set up alerts for unhealthy states
Integrate with Prometheus, Grafana, etc.
Advanced Monitoring
Custom health check hooks
External monitoring agent support
Webhook notifications for status changes
Debugging and Troubleshooting
Detailed sync logs
Configurable log verbosity
Error context preservation
Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è

Ensure secure access to health endpoints
Use authentication and network restrictions
