                                    In this lesson we will examine the different elements that make up a Perspective Session. In this image, we see all of the elements that make up a perspective Session. We have the largest element at the top, and the smallest at the bottom. Starting with the smallest, we see the component. Components are the displays, input fields, tables, and other objects on the screen that your users will be interacting with. All components must be placed into a container. Containers determine where a component is positioned as well as how the component should behave when the browser is resized. Next up is the View. Views are flexible as they can act as a top level screen or a smaller component called an Embedded View. So you can place a View inside of another View. If you wanted to add a sidebar, a popup, or a bunch of smaller, yet complex objects, then you could do that as a single View. This takes us up to the Page, a Page is a collection of Views and a URL associated with that Page. Another way to think about a Page is a single tab in your browser and all of the content contained within it. So you could have that sidebar and that main View and both of those would be placed into a single Page. At the top, we have the Session. A Session is a collection of open Pages from a single browser. When your users launch your Perspective application they're really launching a Session. Now when it comes to working in the Designer, these bottom three elements are the ones we'll be spending most of our time with as they are the most granular and have the most settings. Speaking of the Designer, let's take a look right now. We can see that I have my Designer up and I am in the main Perspective workspace here. If we look down below, we see a couple of tabs. These tabs are showing us the Views that I'm currently editing in the Designer. Now in this one View called Main View, I have a gauge, this would be a component. Now as I click around, you're going to see on the right hand side, the Property Editor is going to show us properties for most of these elements. So I'm looking at the gauge right now, if I click on the background we can see that it selected this thing called root. This is the root container. Other lessons will describe the relationship between a View and its root container. But it's basically the initial container that you can place components into when trying to add them to a View. Now if I head up to the Project Browser, I can select the view which in this case I've named Main View, now as I'm clicking around and working in the Designer here, you'll notice that visually there's not much difference between selecting a View and selecting the root container of a View. Really just the selection in the Project Browser will change as well as the properties in the Property Editor. Again, we'll examine the relationship between the two in other videos. So we're looking at one View here. And if I head down to those tabs at the bottom, I can switch to a different View. This View is a bit more simplistic, I haven't placed any additional components, I've only changed the background color of the root container. So we've seen components, we've seen a container, we've seen some Views. Next up would be a Page. Now next to the tabs at the bottom of this workspace here, you'll notice the cog icon. This takes us back to the root or home of the Perspective workspace. In this section we can configure a Page. So for my entire project, I have a list of Page configurations. Here we see I have something called my Page, which has my main View as the primary View, and then it has that West Dock View, docked to the western edge. We can see that I have another Page here as well with a different View. So I can configure my Pages here. Now there's not really a Session to be defined inside of the Designer. But if you look on the right hand side here, you will see the properties for the Session. So all my components and Views can reference these properties and that can also add my own custom properties here to store whatever values I want. So that was a very brief overview of what all of these elements looked like in the Designer. Let's take a look at an actual Session. So I'm going to minimize my Designer here. And see I have my browser up. We see our gauge from earlier, so we recognize the component. The component is inside of this container which is taking up quite a bit of space in my browser. We know that the View and the container are basically the same size and position. So the entire gray background here would be considered a single View. On the western edge here we see that I have my west docked View. Because we're looking at both Views inside of a single tab here, we know that this is a Page, we can actually see in the URL it has my Page listed here. This also means I can have a separate tab which has a separate Page. Both of these Pages are tied to the same Session because they're in the same browser. So hopefully that gives you a good idea about these five elements of design and how they relate to each other. Understanding that relationship is fundamental to building amazing projects in Perspective.

                                    In this lesson, let's take a look at a View in the Perspective module. Views are a flexible unit of design. They can act as their own, standalone screen or a smaller part of a larger overall Page, such as a sidebar or a popup. When you're in the designer and you're looking at the Perspective module in the Project Browser, you'll see that there's a Views folder. This folder will contain all of the Views within this one project. When you're ready to create a View, you can simply right-click on the folder and select New View or you can click on the Create New View button. In either case, if we try to create a new View it'll give us a little popup window here. Now I'm going to leave these settings with the default values for now and I'll just create the new View. Once created, you can check the Project Browser and see that the new View is nested under the Views folder. If you wanted to keep your project organized, you can right-click on the Views folder and create a new folder. The folder needs a name but I'll just hit the Enter key here to use the default name, and now I can right-click on this new folder and create yet another View. Now, when creating a separate View you may see the little error message here under the Page URL. Other videos will talk about Pages and what's going on here but we can still create the new View by clicking the Create View button. Now, you'll note that it'll create the new View and place it inside of our custom folder we created here, but I now have two Views with the exact same name. Now technically this is okay. There's nothing preventing you from having multiple Views with the same name, although from a design perspective, it may be a good idea to have unique names for each of your Views. If you decide you need to rename a View later on, you can simply right-click on it and select the Rename option. Now, bear in mind, changing the name of a View could have some further implications. So if you had a script later on that was referencing a View by name, renaming could potentially break the script. So it's a good idea to plan ahead or try to stick with some company naming conventions. Now while we can have two Views in the same project with the same name, it's not okay for two Views to have identical paths. To demonstrate, if I try to create a new View in this new folder we just created, it's giving me an error message over here that's telling me that the name is already in use in this directory. All we have to do here is simply change the name of the View then we should be able to create it. Earlier, I mentioned the path to a View. The path of a View is very important. If you ever needed the path of a View typed out, you can simply right-click on the View in the Project Browser and select Copy Path. Now this isn't the only way to get the path to a View. Many other features and Perspective will automatically look up the path for you. This is just a helpful little tip. So if I click on that, and I switch over to a text editor, we can see that when I paste it does have the new folder and then the name of the View, which is just New View. So we talked about creating Views, we talked about looking at them in the Project Browser and renaming them and why the path is important, but now let's actually look at a View. So with the View selected, you can see that it has a list of properties over here including some size properties. So if I needed to change the size of my View I can do it here or I could simply grab the little "resize" icons and move them around. If we head back up to the Project Browser, under any of the Views there's this thing called root and selecting it doesn't really appear to change much in the workspace here, except for the Property Editor, which is now showing properties for the root container. The root here is the root container of the View. The root container is a special container, which you can't actually delete. See, if I right-click on it you'll notice that deleting is disabled. Technically, the root container is the thing that's holding your components when you start placing them into the View. Now the semantics of it don't really matter too much now, but later on, it's important to understand that when you're adding a component to a View really you're adding a component to a container that's inside of that View.

                                    In this lesson, we'll talk about Perspective Pages. A Page is a parent object to any number of children Views. So when you're in the designer and you're at the root of the Perspective module there's this Page configuration area here. So when you create a Page it doesn't sit in the Project Browser, rather it sits in this list here. Now when you're starting off in a new project if you try to create a new View here, it gives you the normal naming dialog which also has this Page URL property. Right now this property is enabled by default because my project doesn't yet have a Page configured. The designer tries to help you out by creating a Page for you and mounting the View to that Page. So in this case it's going to create a Page of just a slash which we can think of as the Home Page or the root Page of the project if I click the create button here. So now that we have our View we can head back to Page configuration, and you'll see that our Page is now in the list. Additionally our new View has been assigned to that Page. We can also see that when we select the Page the primary View has been set. So we very quickly just created a View, created a Page and then mounted the View into a Page. Now if I try creating a new View again, and change the name here, this time I'll name it A. You'll notice that when I change the name the Page URL also changed to match. Now of course you can change the name of the Page if you'd like. Meaning that you don't need the name of your View to match the name of your Page. You'll also see that the Page URL is disabled by default. After your project has at least one Page configured this little check box is disabled by default, but of course you can always re-enable it. So in this case I do want to create a new Page and automatically mount it. Now I'll hit the create View button. And now if we head back we can see that my A Page exists. Now if you wanted to create a Page without creating a View as well, say you already created a bunch of Views, there is a little plus icon you can hit here that simply adds a new Page for you. You just need to remember to set the primary View when you're ready to launch. And of course if you don't want a Page anymore you can simply select it and hit the trash can to remove it. Now let's go back to our Views and add some components just to make them look a little different. I'll add a Cylindrical Tank to New View. I'll switch over to A, and add an LED display. I'm going to save my project. And then let's head back to the cog icon so we can take a look at the Page configuration. If I want to go to my first Page here I can simply select the Page, right click and then launch the URL. Your browser will open up and you should see that first Page. Now if you've been wondering why there's been a slash in the Page names here that's because the name of the Page effectively goes at the end of this URL. So that first, or the home Page of the project here simply doesn't have any characters, although I could add some if I wanted to. If I need to get to this next Page here I can simply update my URL with an A, hit Enter, and it will load that Page. Now of course I could actually add buttons and other navigation components to handle the switching here. Now if for some reason you try to go to a Page that doesn't have any Views mounted, like our New Page here. If I type that in real quick you'll get a little message saying that the Page doesn't have a View associated with it. So if you're trying to View a Page from your project in your browser and you get this "View Not Found" message that generally means either you don't have a primary View configured for the Page or you do and you just haven't saved the project yet. Now hopefully you have a good understanding about what a Page is. It certainly is a unit of design, but because it has a URL associated with it, it's also a means of navigation as you'll see in later videos.

                                    In this video, we'll take a look at passing parameters to a Page. So by "pass parameters", we mean the Page URL here, we can add parameters here. Our primary View can see whatever parameters we passed in and components inside the View can bind or use the values of those in some useful way. So you can see, I already have a Page, I've called it Tank and it has a primary View of Tank. I'm going to switch over to that View and I'm going to head over to the Component Palette here, under the Display category. Let's grab a Cylindrical Tank and place that on the View. So to start with, I would like to be able to pass a parameter into the URL as a number, and then show that number on the tank. So the way this works is that if you select your View, so not the root container, but the View itself, and then if you check the Property Editor, there's a special category of properties called the Params category. These properties here are exposed on the View, meaning that the Page can directly pass something to this. So if I hit the little plus button here, and add a new value property, I'll name this new property Level, and give it a value of 50 just to start with. Now let's make it so that the value on the Tank is looking at the Level property. I'll select my Tank, I'll find the value property, hit the little binding icon, and let's just do a basic Property Binding. I'll hit the little Property Browser button. We'll go down to the View. We'll go down to the Params folder. We'll expand, and we'll find the Level property. I'll hit OK. We can see in the preview that it's working. So I'll hit OK on the binding. So now that our component is looking at that Level property, we can do something with that. Let's head back to the cog icon so we can take a look at our Page configuration. The way you add parameters to the Page URL is by clicking in here, putting a slash down, typing a colon, the colon's important because this denotes that the next little string of text I'm going to type, is a reference to a parameter. Type our parameter, which is Level. So now, if we navigate to this Page URL, and if there's something after /Tank, our Page will try to take that something and place it into the Level property that's on the View. So let's save our project. I'm going to launch this Page. I'll right-click on it and launch the URL. We'll open up our browser here. Now because I'm launching it from the Page configuration, it's trying to put our parameter in the URL, but I can simply replace that with a number and hit Enter, which will reload the Page. And now my Tank is looking at whatever number I typed up here in the URL. So it's entirely possible for you to copy this or add some buttons, go to a separate Page with a different number and have two different Tanks with different values. Now you might be thinking, this is kind of a contrived example, right? I don't want the actual value of my display to be tied to something that's in the URL, which is true in most cases, you wouldn't want to populate any sort of display component like this with something in the URL. But when you start thinking about using indirect tag bindings and expressions, suddenly these parameters become considerably more interesting. The Page itself can act like a template, allowing you to design one Page but show different information simply by changing the URL just slightly.

                                    In this lesson, we'll take a look at the Coordinate Container. The Coordinate Container is a very simple container, as it allows you to specify the X and Y position of your components. To begin, we're in the Perspective section of our designer. Let's create a new View, and let's call this "Coordinate". I'm going to use the Coordinate layout, so that the root container is a Coordinate container. And in this case, I'll have it create a Page URL. We'll hit the Create View button here. Once we have our View, let's add a component. I'll head over to the Component Palette, and let's grab, under the Display category, a Cylindrical Tank, and drop that into the container. Now if I try clicking and dragging on the component, I can reposition the component in the container, as well as resize it. As I'm doing this, we notice in the Property Editor, under the Position category, that the X, Y, width, and height change depending on what I do to the component here. When I launch the Session and look at this View, the tank will be at roughly the same coordinates as it is right now in the designer. So let's save the project. Now, I mounted this View to the first Page in my project, so if I go to Tools at the top, Launch Perspective and Launch Session, it should show me this View. We see our browser opens up, and the positioning here is about what I'd expect. Now you'll see that when I resize my browser, the tank doesn't change size or reposition. Now this can be a good thing and a bad thing. It's good because I don't have to worry about my components being warped and being unreadable. But if I make my session too narrow, my components won't automatically resize, and I'll get scroll bars at the bottom. So the coordinate container is great to start of with, but if you plan on launching your sessions on a variety of different screen sizes, you'll find that it's not very flexible. Now we can make a slight change to this, if I move back to my Designer here. And if I select the root container, which is our Coordinate container, we'll notice the Mode property here. When the Mode property is set to fixed, it behaves precisely as I just showed you. Components inside this container will be in a fixed position regardless of how you resize the session. We could also change this to Percent. Percent will allow the component to resize. Now, if we were to save our project, when we start resizing our session now you'll notice that the tank also resizes. Even the empty spaces on both sides of the tank, those are shrinking and growing as I change the browser width. So if the screens you're going to launch your session on only have a very small amount of variance in monitor size, the Coordinate container set to the Percent mode may work well as a root container. Now if you're looking for truly responsive design, the coordinate container doesn't work very well as the root container. Instead, it works great as a separate component. I'll head back to my component palette, and take a look at the container category. We see our Coordinate container as a component, I can just drag and drop that onto the View, and I'll resize it just a little bit. Double-click on the new Coordinate container to deeply select it and then start placing components inside of here. So I could use a Coordinate container as a smaller container to hold components that I don't want to move around, such as a bunch of labels and smaller displays, and place that Coordinate container inside of a more responsive container, such as a Flex container or Column container.

                                    In this lesson, we'll explore the column container type which is designed to simplify and streamline design work, allowing for displays that are quick to create and easy to manage. To get us started here, we'll go ahead and create a new view. So, I'll go ahead and find the Perspective heading in the Project browser. Right click on Views and then select New View. Inside of here, I'll go ahead and give my new view a name. So how about Column? And then next, I'll go ahead and specify the root container type of My View to Column. So this will go ahead and create our column container for us as the root container of the view. Finally, I'll go ahead and leave that page URL check box checked, which is going to make this Column view the primary view for our root page. And then I'll click Create View. And right away, we can already see our column container in action. Our workspace here, is divided into 12 evenly spaced columns with small gaps or gutters in between each column. The principle idea behind a column container here, is that rather than spending time worrying about alignment and positioning, we can just slot components directly into this grid structure. So inside of our layout here, let's go ahead and add a couple components. So I'm going to come up to my Perspective Component Palette. And how about we add a cylindrical tank into our view? So when I drop that cylindrical tank into my column container, it's going to take up just one column. But if I'd like, I can click and drag to make my cylindrical tank wider, and I can also click and drag to make my component taller. And that's all I have to do to figure out how my component should look inside of my column container. I've effectively just slotted it into position in this grid and given it the appropriate width and height. Next, I'm going to go ahead and duplicate this cylindrical tank by hold down CTRL and then dragging the mouse. And now I've given my cylindrical tank a friend. Now there's one, additional piece of functionality that's critical to how the column container works. In the top, right here, we see a Column Breakpoints section. This is here because the column container is built specifically for responsive design strategies. In layman's terms, we have given you the opportunity to make your column container look different at different screen sizes, with the express goal that you can make your components here, look good on anything from a smart phone to a tablet to a full desktop environment. The way that this works is I can select a breakpoint, let's say my large breakpoint here, and then I'm given a chance to configure how the components in my container should look at large screen sizes. More accurately, this is how they should look when my container is more than 996 pixels wide because that's the number that we have, here. So for instance, on a very large display, let's say that I only want my cylindrical tanks to be three columns wide and I want to put them adjacent to each other, just like this. So when I'm running on a 1080P monitor, let's say, this is how my view is going to look. If I go back to my medium breakpoint, we'll see that the cylindrical tanks there are exactly as we left them. If I had configured any bindings or scripts on those components, they've carried over through all three breakpoints. The only difference between the three breakpoints is how we arrange the components inside of the container. So for my medium breakpoint, let's say that I want the breakpoint to be at a slightly larger width; let's say 700 pixels. So now, if this column container's width is between 700 and 996 pixels, we will use this medium version. If the width is any smaller than 700 pixels, let's say that we're on a mobile device, we'll use this small version. So on the small version with Small selected here, let's do something a little bit fancier. Instead of putting my cylindrical tanks adjacent to each other, I'm going to go ahead and stack them. So I'll take this second cylindrical tank and drag it onto the next row. And then I'll make each of my cylindrical tanks be full width of the container, so all 12 columns. It's important to keep in mind that as you're arranging the components in the smallest breakpoint here, that all 12 columns are going to be shown inside of the session. The only difference is, on a mobile device, the columns will be very narrow, whereas on a large monitor, the columns will be very wide. That means when we're working in this small breakpoint like this, we want to make our components take up more columns so they can account for each column being narrower. So now that we have our three breakpoints set up, let's go ahead and take a look at this in a real session. So I'm going to save my project and then I'm going to come to Tools, Launch Perspective, and Launch Session. And now, if I come and make my browser very wide, this is how my cylindrical tanks will look, just as we've configured them in the large breakpoint. But then as we make the session narrower, so we start simulating working on say, a tablet, or a lower resolution display, we eventually start getting the medium breakpoint kicking in. And then finally, once we get to that smallest breakpoint, we've stacked the components on top of each other. So the basic principle behind the column container is that you can quickly whip up a view that will work well at any screen size, and allow you to quickly orient and align components.

                                    In this lesson, we'll take a look at the Tab container. The Tab container is a single component with multiple sub-containers, one for each tab. Let's get started, we'll create a brand new View. I'll click the, Create New View button here. I'm going to create a new View called "Tab". I'm going to change the layout to a Tab container, so that our root container uses a Tab container. And let's make a Page so we can look at this, in a Session later. I'll create the view and you can see that the root container is starting off with some tabs. Now if I select the Tab container, you'll notice in the Property Editor, the "Tabs" property. This property is an array. Each element inside of the array, represents a different tab on the component. The value of the element corresponds to the text on the tab. So if I wanted to start titling my tabs, I can simply give a value to each element. If you wanted to add a new tab, you can simply come over to the top here, the little plus icon while you're in design mode and it will add a new tab for you in the array. You can also hit the little plus icon here, add a new value object, and it will add a new item here, with a default value of value. If you needed to remove a tab, of course, just remove the element here or in the Design mode here, you can just click the little x above the tab. It'll ask you to confirm, hit the delete button and the tab goes away. There are a number of style properties down here. For example, we can change the menu type from classic to modern, to give it a more modern feel as we're clicking around. Now when you put the Designer into Preview mode here, you'll notice a couple things. One, you can't remove the tabs anymore, so from the session, we don't allow users to remove tabs. But we're also getting a warning. This is because we haven't placed any components into the sub-containers. Let's go back to design mode. Adding a component is as easy as selecting the tab, coming over to the Component Palette, and drag the component into the container. And just like that, you can see that my gauge here is filling up the entire container. When we have the gauge or the component selected, you'll notice that the position properties here, really only list the tab index. So, if I wanted to change which tab this is located on, I can simply change this to a different number. Now if I head over to index position 1, we should see our gauge. You'll also notice that the component tries to fill up as much space as possible inside of the sub-container. So how would I add multiple components to the same sub-container? I'll switch over to my first tab here, and the way you accomplish that is very simple, you simply need to add either a container to this one sub-container or an embedded view. So for right now, I'll head over to the Component Palette. I'm going to grab a Coordinate container and simply drag that into the sub-container. You can see that the Coordinate container is now inside of this tab here. And if I double click to deeply select the coordinate container, I can start dragging components into here, allowing me to resize, reposition, as well as add additional components inside of this container. Now let's go ahead and save our project here. Click on the cog icon, taking us back to page configuration, and let's take a look at this in our Session. So I'll right click on the page and select Launch URL. If I switch over to my browser here, we can see that I have my first tab here with the Coordinate container and its sub-components. I can switch over to my second tab which now has this one gauge. So now you should have a basic understanding of how the Tab container works. If you wanted to make this more interesting, you could of course have multiple tiers of tabs, which you can accomplish by nesting another Tab container into each sub-container of our original Tab container.

                                    In this lesson we'll take a look at the Breakpoint container. A Breakpoint container has two separate configurations, a small configuration and a large configuration, which are also called its children. Depending on how wide the session is, the Breakpoint will try to use either the large or the small child. Let's get started by creating a new View. I'll name this view Breakpoint. I'll change the layout to the Breakpoint container and let's make sure we check the page URL here. So we have an easy way to launch this and view it from the session. I'll create the View. Before we begin, let's talk about what we're going to do. I have this Breakpoint container but I also have a couple of other Views here. I have a large View, which has several gauges, I also have a small View, which has one gauge, and a couple of moving analog indicators. I'm going to configure the Breakpoint container so it shows the small View while narrow and the large View while it's wide. So let's go back to our Breakpoint view and I'll select the root container here, and you may have noticed in the upper right hand corner of the Property Editor here we have some additional properties. We can see that our breakpoint is determined up here but on the root container it's also listed as a props property allowing you to bind this if you want. You can also switch between the children by clicking on them up above. Switching between the children allows you to choose which child you're editing in the designer. Now in addition to typing in a new breakpoint here I can also grab the slider at the top here to adjust where my breakpoint is. Now I want to show off two Views. You can only add a single component to each child in the Breakpoint container but you can place containers or Embedded Views. In my case because I'm trying to show off some Views let's use an Embedded View. I'll head over to the Component Palette and under the Embedding category there's our Embedded View and I'll drag the component into the Breakpoint container. Now if I minimize the component pallet we can take a look, we see that I have my Embedded View selected. So these properties over here are for the Embedded View. I'll go ahead and change the path to my large View. So you can see that I'm showing my large View inside of my small child. Now I actually have this backwards, I want to show off the large View, under the large child. But really I just wanted to show you that you can switch back and forth by clicking on the children. Now similar to other containers that can only contain a single component if we try to View this in the session now, or put the design in Preview mode, we will see a little warning here telling us that we don't have a child inside of this container. So let's make some small changes here. I'm going to go back to Design mode and I still have my Embedded View selected. We can take a look at the position properties for the container and we notice there's only a size property. This allows me to switch which child my component is positioned in. So I need to move this Embedded View to the large child. So I'll hit the little drop down here, select large, and now we can see that my Embedded View is positioned under the large child. I'm going to switch back to the small child, grab another Embedded View, come back down to the Component Palette, go to the Embedding category and we'll grab an Embedded View and drop that off into our container. Now you've probably noticed already I can select each individual component independently of whichever child I have selected here. So you'll definitely want to pay attention to whatever is currently selected in the Project Browser. So let's go ahead and select our newly created Embedded View and let's set the path here to the small View and hit okay. Now that we're set let's save our project, let's head back to the cog icon so that we can take a look at the page configuration. I'll right click on my page and select Launch URL. And when the project loads here you can see that we're showing the large breakpoint. If I reduce the size of my browser it switches to the smaller View. So now I have a way to just resize my browser and get a completely different View. So if you're trying to build a project with responsive design in mind the Breakpoint container is an ideal container to get familiar with.

                                    In this lesson we're going to be talking about the Flex Container. So let's go ahead and add one to our screen. But it is important to note that when we look at the Flex Container there are two very similar components. I'll just filter out my list here and you can see that we have both a Flex Container and a Flex Repeater. We're going to be talking about the Flex Repeater in another video. So let's grab the Flex Container and we'll go ahead and drag one onto the screen. Now with the Flex Container, we want to talk about the layout and how components work inside of the container. So the first thing that we need to do here is deeply select the container, and then we can go and add a couple components. Now I'm going to add a few buttons. I'll add three of them here. We can just drag them into the screen. And then once we have them on the screen, we can select them and then go and change the text property.

**[01:00]** [01:00]
                                    So, I'll set the first one to one, the second one to two, and the third one, three, so that way we can tell them apart. Now you'll notice that we have a new panel up here at the top of the Perspective Property Editor and there's a bunch of buttons that control how the layout works inside of the Flex Container. You can control whether the components are displayed as a column or a row. You can set how much of the container they span with the Items field here. And you can set how they're spread through the container with the justify. And we can resize the container and see how they react. Now if I drop the deep selection by clicking on the background, then I can grab my corner here, and drag my components around. Now let's set these components to be very thin, and you can see they'll smush up here. And then we can set another layout property by deep selecting the Flex Container and then changing the Children to wrap. And then, you can see here that the components will actually wrap onto new lines if they need the space.

**[02:05]** [02:05]
                                    Now this also gives you the ability to change your Content property. So we can align things on the top, on the bottom, in the center, however we want. And if we go out of our deep selection, then we can change the sizes around and see how this reacts. All right, now let's set the container's layout back to its defaults, that way we can talk about the component's position properties. So I'll set to not wrap, and we'll set it to stretch and justify there. Now each component inside the container has a set of position properties, the grow, shrink, basis and display. The display property is going to show or hide the component. Similar to how the visible property works, but it's a little bit different in that it will actually remove the component. So if I change my visible to false, you can see buttons two and three are still in the same location. But if I change my display to false, then buttons two and three move over to take up that missing space. The basis property is the preferred width of the component.

**[03:05]** [03:05]
                                    I can change this manually or I can grab one of the handles here, and stretch the component out. The basis can be a number of pixels or it could be a percentage like 50%. If you set it to a percentage, then when you adjust the container width, then you can see that the component will actually change and always be half of that container. If I deep-select the container and select the button, and changed our basis back to pixels, so something like 80px, then we can take a look at the grow and shrink properties. The shrink property allows the components to become smaller when there's not enough room for them. You can see when I make my container more narrow, the components all shrink. This is because they all have a shrink value of one. I can select one of my components, and then set the shrink value to something that's not one, so, say, zero here, and that means that this particular component won't shrink. So now when I move my container around, you can see that buttons one and two shrink but button three does not.

**[04:06]** [04:06]
                                    The grow property allows a component to grow past its basis. So if I select button one and I change my grow to one, and if I make my container much larger, you can see that particular component will grow to fill all the space. If multiple components have a nonzero grow value, then they will grow at the same rate, assuming they have the same value. You can see with them both set to one, both buttons will grow and shrink at the same rate here. Now because these are relative rates, if I select button two, and then set the grow value to something like four, then it will grow at a rate four times as much as button one, as we can see here, if I change the container size. Now that we know the basics, let's look at a more complex example. I have a nested Flex Container here that has a column with a bunch of Flex Container rows inside of it. Now, it's important to note that the Property Editor, the buttons that show all the different layout values for our container, is going to be based on what's currently deeply selected.

**[05:13]** [05:13]
                                    So if I select one of these nested Flex Containers, which you can see in our project browser here, then you'll notice that the layout buttons still have that column setting, whereas our properties are showing a direction of row. That's because the root container's still deeply selected, which you can see from the little bullseye icon on the root container. Now if I deeply select one of these containers, then you'll notice that our bullseye icon changes here and now we have deeply selected in the Flex Container. And if we go to our Property Editor here, we can see that now the buttons are based on what we have selected. Now one last note, all of this Flex Container stuff is based on a web tool that's called Flex Box, and you can find tons of information online and even a few games that you can play to learn a little bit more about how these layouts will interact with each other.

                                    In this lesson we'll take a look at the Perspective Module's Session Props. Session Props are properties that are available throughout the entire session. Each instance of the session gets its own copy of the Session Props and they can contain unique values. So for our example I have two Views here. So I have a Docked View which has a Label in it, I have my Primary View which has a Text Field component. I would like to be able to type into the Text Field component and then move the value to the Label. There are a couple ways to approach this, you can use Message Handlers through scripting, but I could also just create my own custom Session Prop, and basically use that as a link between the two components. So let's actually look at the Session Props. If we come down to the little cog icon here and click on it, that takes us back to the root of the Perspective Module in our project, and that list of properties on the right-hand side, these would be our Session Props. So we have a bunch of built-in ones that are ready to go for you and these are available throughout the entire session. So for example, if you wanted to bind something on one of your Views to the geolocation properties, it's very easy to set up. You can additionally create your own down below under the custom section. So when you create a custom Session Prop, it's fundamentally very similar to the Vision Module's client tags. So to create a Session Prop, you can just click on the little Add Custom Properties area here, I'll create a value property, and we'll just give the key a name, I'll just type in myText. So let's go back to our components, and then we'll bind them to this property, and again we'll use this property as sort of a middle man or in between, between those two components. So back on my Docked View here, I'll select my Label component, we'll find the text property, click on the binding icon, and if we head over to the Property type binding, don't have to worry about typing in here, we can just use the little Property Browser button. And we won't worry about finding anything inside of our View, again these Session Props live in the session, they're available anywhere. So we'd want to go over to the session area. We'll go down to the custom folder, we'll grab myText, and we'll hit OK. You can see that it's kicking in already, it's using that default value that was just there when we created our property. I'll hit OK here, we'll switch over to the primary View, and we'll basically do the same thing. I'll select my text field, go to the binding icon, do a property binding, and again we'll go ahead and just grab the exact same property. So session, custom, myText, and hit OK. Now in this case, I want my users to be able to type into the Text Field. So if they do that, then I want to write back to the custom prop, so in this case we definitely want the binding to be bidirectional. We'll hit OK here, and let's try this out in the Designer before we go to our session. I'll put it into Preview mode, and if I type something over here, I can head back to the root of the Perspective Module, we can see that the value of myText has changed, and of course if we go back to my Docked View, so the last part in this little chain here, we can see that the text property on the label has updated. So that's all fine and dandy but let's save our project. I'll save again. And if I go back to the root of our Perspective Module here, you can see that I did create a page initially which has my Docked View and my Primary View. We'll go ahead and just launch this real quick, and when my browser comes up here you can see our two components, change the text in here, and we see that it worked. So hopefully that gives you a good idea as to what the Session Prop is. It's basically a way for you to take one value, put it into a spot that's available throughout the entire session, and then your other components in your other Views can bind to it or use it in some useful way.

                                    While viewing a Perspective session you may have noticed this little button in the lower right-hand corner. If you click on it, you'll see a bar appear. This is the app bar, or application bar. This is a small piece of the interface that allows you to view some meta and diagnostic information about the session, as well as the gateway hosting the session. From this bar there are a couple of other buttons. Starting on the far left-hand side here, if I click on the Ignition logo, and then scroll down a little bit, we'll see some information about the various modules that are installed on the gateway. I'll close this here, and the center button will display the name of the gateway, that's hosting the project. If you click on it you'll see some options here, including some information about your gateway, by clicking right here where it says Connected. I can also switch over and see some information about the project such as the last time it was updated. I'll back out of this window here. You'll also see that there's a little SIGN IN button. Now you'll only see this if you have an identity provider configured for the project. By clicking this button I can sign in to the session. Now if you've watched the other videos here, you know that there's a couple of different ways to sign in, be it the component action, or by setting security-level access. This is just another option. Now, say you didn't want the app bar to appear in the session, or even the little button that calls the app bar. Fortunately, there's an easy way to do that. I'm going to switch over to my designer. While in the designer, if you're under the Perspective workspace, if you look under SESSION PROPS there's an appBar object, and under that is a togglePosition property. By default, togglePosition is set to right, which means the little button we click to call that bar will be placed in the lower right-hand corner. Now I can instead change this to either the left side or just hide it entirely. So if I select hidden and then save my project, I can switch back over to my session, and you'll notice that I don't have the little button anymore. So now I can't call the app bar for my session. Now, say I want to conditionally call the app bar, say for troubleshooting reasons. There are a couple of ways to do this. I'm going to head back to my designer. And for that togglePosition property we could always just place a binding on here that checks some criteria. Alternatively, we could give our users the ability to call the app bar if they needed it. So I could switch over to a view, and I do have this little ToggleSwitch I added to this view. So my goal here is I want my users to be able to click on the ToggleSwitch and then call the app bar. This is easy enough to do because there's actually a page property that allows you to call the app bar. What I'm going to do here is I'm going to place a binding on the selected property, and I'm going to select a property binding. So if I were to browse properties on the page object, if I were to expand this, we do have some properties here, and we have our appBarVisible property. So if I write a true value to this, it calls the app bar, and of course if I write a false value it hides the app bar. Even better, writing to this property on the page object will show the app bar only for this one session. So if I change the value on this property it won't make the app bar appear in other sessions. So I can click on OK here, and I want this binding to write to that property so I will make sure this is bidirectional, I'll hit OK, I'll save my project, and if we switch back, so again, I didn't add the built-in app bar toggle, but instead I can throw my custom one, and it will summon the app bar.

**[00:00]** [00:00]
                                    In this lesson, we'll take a look at perspective workstation. Workstation as a standalone application, designed to launch perspective sessions using an embedded web browser. To begin with, we'll have to make sure perspective workstation is installed. Starting with ignition version 8.1 you can get perspective workstation directly from the gateway's web interface. So here I have my gateway open, I'm on the home section here, and there's this little perspective workstation area. I'll go ahead and click the download perspective workstation button, which takes us to a separate page. From here there should be a big download button which will download an installer that you can run, which will install perspective workstation on your local system. And again, this is very similar to the designer launcher. So I won't show you the installation steps. You can just run through the installer or check out the designer launcher video if you wanted a walk through. But we'll skip over that for this lesson here. And instead you can see that I do have perspective workstation. Already I have a desktop icon ready to go.

**[01:00]** [01:00]
                                    So let me double click to open this up. And once you finish installing it on your end, you should see a window that looks something like this, though more appropriately, you won't have these applications already. So I'll go ahead and edit. Let me delete these here. We'll add them back in. So yours probably looks something like this on a fresh installation. Now you might also get a prompt asking you if you wanted to add applications from available gateways, which you can go ahead and opt into. In my case, I'll go ahead and click the add application button here, where you'll see a separate window appear. And from here, we can see a list of all of the detectable gateways that workstation can find. And we do have some tabs at the top here. So if you've been adding applications from other gateways, you'll see them in this previously used list, or you can just type in the URL for the gateway if you wanted to go to a specific one that wasn't being broadcast for some reason. Now in my case I'll go ahead and stick to my local system here. I'll select that gateway and click the select gateway button. And then we'll get a project listing from all the available projects on that gateway. I'll just add both of these and click add applications.

**[02:02]** [02:02]
                                    And there we are. We have our two applications now, or however many you added. If need to add more applications later, the add applications button is in the lower right hand corner. If you wanted to launch one of these, you can simply select and then click open application or just double click on the little box here. And we can see it's opening up and there we are. We're now running in our session. So let me resize this a little bit. And there you are. So we can see that we have a Perspective Session running inside of its own window. It's not using some of your more consumer grade or common web browsers, right? So it's not using like Chrome or Firefox or anything. So this is ideal if you wanted to run a perspective session on a plant floor and you didn't want to have all the normal trappings of a web browser like bookmarks and plugins and the address bar that anyone could type into stuff like that. Looking at features here. So I do have a couple of buttons. I went ahead and I put together before this recording. So, let's go and take a look at the full screen button. If I press that, then workstation goes full screen. If I click on windowed, it goes back to a windowed mode.

**[03:04]** [03:04]
                                    And then of course I have toggle. So I can kind of dance back and forth between the two. Now to actually talk about what that's doing here, I'm going to switch over to my designer. And I have the view we were just looking at open here. If I were to start deeply selecting down into these buttons here, and we would take a look at what's going on on the events side of things. So I do have a scripting component event here. And if I scroll down here, we can see I'm using this system.perspective.workstation toKiosk function. So workstation does get its own special functions. That's why it has the extra workstation at the end there. So if you try to call this in a perspective session that isn't running in workstation so just one that's running in a browser or the mobile app, these functions won't work. So this script here is using the toKiosks function, which puts workstation into a full screen mode. While the windowed button here is using the toWindow function, which puts workstation back into a windowed mode. Now this toggle button down here, which I'll switch over to and start deep selecting down.

**[04:02]** [04:02]
                                    If we take a look at this, instead of using a script action here, I'm actually using a workstation mode. So there's a new action we added here, which more or less gives you the same thing. Allows you to switch between the full screen and the windowed mode, or in this case I have it set to toggle. So it just kind of bounces back and forth every time it triggers. Now the next thing I did want to talk about here is this link. So I have this Link component up here. And it's actually set to tabs. So the idea being when a user clicks on this, it opens a tab. Now as you saw from earlier, workstation doesn't really have a concept of tabs. There weren't any tabs running in there. So what happens in this scenario? So let's go ahead and launch it again so I can take a look. And if I click that link, you get a whole lot of nothing. So in this case, nothing's happening, but that's actually intentional. So if we take a look at the application that was added into workstation here. I'll go ahead and click on the little kebab or triple dots there. And I'll click on manage. And over here, we have this tab slash window links property.

**[05:05]** [05:05]
                                    So this determines what should happen if the user does something that would normally open a new tab in their web browser. So in this case, we can block it. But we do have some options. So we can do in window, which means, okay, go ahead and just navigate to that from within workstation. We also have system browser, which would instead open up the native or the default browser on your operating system and look at that address. So if I were to try that out real quick. And if I try that again. Looks like Firefox is opening. And you can see it's navigating to that page. So you do get some flexibility in regards to what you want to do when we try to, or when the user tries to open up a tab. Now let's take a look at the managing these applications again. So going back to the application, click the kebab menu, we'll go to manage. And I'll switch over to page configuration. And from here, you can set the application to run in a sort of a multi monitored mode, if you will. Not really a mode, but you can actually have multiple windows open up when you launch this application.

**[06:09]** [06:09]
                                    Now heading back into my designer here, I switched back to the landing page or the homepage here. You can see that I do have a separate page setup, a page2, in addition to the default or the root page. So what we could do, just because this is kind of hard to demonstrate when I'm only recording a single screen here. How about display one here? We'll go to page two, so I can do a "/page2". And then display two, we'll just go to that root. So just slash. Now you can figure out, which display is what. There is an Identify Displays button here, which when I press it, we can see that you are looking at my display 1. And you're also seeing three displays here because workstation does detect how many screens or displays are available. So it just so happens that the system I'm recording on does in fact have three displays. But we won't do anything with that third one. So I'll go ahead and click okay, here. We'll double click the launch. And notice that has a little multi-monitor icon there just letting me know that this application is configured to run with multiple displays.

**[07:11]** [07:11]
                                    All right, so we see, we have one instance here. We have that second page. Let me switch over. And you can see, here we are. We have that first one we were looking at earlier here. So you can have an application configured in such a way that when you run it, it does open up onto multiple displays, which is very, very useful. All right. And that about wraps up the workstation video. As again, it's very similar to the Designer Launch if you've used that before, but it does have a couple of unique configurations, like the multi-monitor capability, as well as the built-in sort of support with the component actions and the system functions.

                                    In this lesson, we'll examine how a running perspective session fits into the rest of the ignition ecosystem. Now, this isn't critical information to building and deploying applications with perspective but it should give you some additional information on how the module works, which hopefully can lead to helping you make better decisions while designing a project. So say you have a running ignition gateway on a server somewhere, and it's connected to some devices some databases, and some other things it can request data from. Now say a user launches a perspective session and a web browser or it could be the mobile app or a perspective workstation. The exact approach doesn't really matter too much. The point here is that a user on a separate device starts up a perspective session. As with most things in ignition, when some subsystems such as our session here requests information from an external system, the request is sent to the gateway which then handles the retrieval of that information.

**[01:04]** [01:04]
                                    For example, say the perspective session is displaying a temperature from a sensor somewhere. In that case the session just pulls the gateway for the data depending on how that data is being retrieved normally the gateway may already have it sitting on a tag but if not, then it has to go and query for it or make some sort of call to retrieve it. But generally speaking the session only ever requests the information from the gateway. It doesn't go and retrieve the information directly. Instead, the gateway is always acting as an intermediary. Now, when we talk about perspective sessions really there are two sides to a session. The side you're familiar with at this point is the front end of the session. This side is what your users will interact with and also see. Having a front end would imply that there's a back end, which there is. However, it's not necessarily sitting on the same device as the front end. It's actually running on the server. The reason for this is related to the tech stack we're using.

**[02:03]** [02:03]
                                    I'm not going to delve too deeply into the details but the main takeaway is that there is a side of each session that runs on the server. It's also means that data sent to the session from the gateway is actually sent to the back end of the session which can then process the data and notify the front end if it needs to. Now this means the two sides put some effort into mirroring each other. For example, say the front end is rendering a checkbox component. All components have properties that determine their state and sometimes those properties change how the component looks. So our checkbox has a select a property. And right now it's set to false because it's not checked at the moment. The front end is aware of the selected property and the false value it has. The back end also knows that the checkbox has a false value for its selected property. The front end and the back end are both aware of the properties of all the components within the session. And they're also aware of the values on all those properties. The two sides have a fairly robust synchronization system.

**[03:04]** [03:04]
                                    So changes to a component property on one side will cause the other side to update its value appropriately. So say our user clicks on the checkbox which should change the selected value to true. The front end knows the user did it because while they clicked on the component, that in turn changes the selected value and renders the little check mark on the component. The front end then notifies the back end that the value on the select a property of the component changed. Thus, the back end updates, the select value on its side. Now this synchronization is bi-directional meaning changes to the value on the back end will update the front end also. Since the back end is responsible for the session's data management, this means things that can automatically change the value on a property, such as a property binding actually change the value on the back end allowing the synchronization system to then notify the front end. So for another example, say we have a tag binding on the selected value of our checkbox and the gateway just informed the back end that the value on that tag has changed.

**[04:07]** [04:07]
                                    So now it should be false. The back end updates the property value on its side which means the synchronization system will then update the value on the front end. The front end receives the new value the next time it renders the check box the check mark is removed and the user sees the false value on the component. Okay, so we see how this works but what does that actually mean for you? Is it important that, you know, a session is made up of a front end and a back end and there's some synchronization that happens automatically between the two sides? Well, not really, if I didn't mention it to you you probably would never realize that, that's how it works. That's just how seamlessly it blends in. However, the idea that each session has a back end side running on the gateway is useful. We're back here at our system diagram. Now say in a perspective view somewhere you have a button component and when the user presses the button, it calls a Python script.

**[05:04]** [05:04]
                                    The script likely doesn't execute where you think it does. It actually executes here on the back end, not the front end even though it was triggered by a user doing something to the component on the front end. And that's because, well, it can't. User scripting, can't run in a browser and that's honestly just how web browsers work. They have a lot of security measures to make sure that pages they're displaying don't run arbitrary and potentially malicious code on the system hosting the browser. However, the front end is allowed to send a notification to the back end, saying that a script was triggered. So the back end knows the script is triggered and is able to execute the code. Now, this approach has two ramifications. First scripts use the resources of the server not the system hosting the front end. Say you have a script that does some heavy calculations. Those calculations will probably use a significant amount of system resources. Now say you call that script from some interaction in a perspective session. Okay, so the server runs the script and finishes the calculations.

**[00:00]** [00:00]
                                    [06:07]         Now a single instance of your session has the result of that calculation and a single instance, isn't really a concern but this whole process is sort of multiplied by the number of active sessions, trying to run the same code. So you start to run into this problem where the system is doing a lot of repetitive work and potentially running that same script over and over again, getting the same results which ends up being really wasteful. Even worse this could potentially lead you towards performance or just resource issues. Now, in cases like these, if you have some sort of heavyweight scripting that needs to run. It's advised to try to run the script only once at a time and then distribute the results. That way the system's doing less overall work. So you could have a gateway event script or a tag chain script to run the calculation once and then store the results somewhere that's easily accessible such as a memory tag or even in a database table.

**[07:00]** [07:00]
                                    From there, you can use a simple binding to retrieve the information which scales considerably better in cases where you have a large number of sessions running at the same time. The second ramification you'll want to be aware of is that well, your scripts do in fact run in a different environment than where they're called from. For example, the Python standard library and also ignitions built in system library have functions that allow you to interact with the local file system. But local is a peculiar term in this case, because again, they always run on the server. So those functions would allow you to interact with the file system on the server not the system that's hosting the front end. Well that about wraps things up. Hopefully now you have a better idea of what's going on when a session is running. Those two scenarios we illustrated here aren't very common, but there's something to be aware of as you could accidentally design your project in such a way, that you do run into those issues.

                                    In this lesson, we'll talk about Docked Views in Perspective. So we can see that I have a session in front of me and it's showing a single View right now. I would like to add a View to one of the edges here, so maybe just something on the northern edge. So let's take a look in the Designer here. Now I have a couple of Views ready to go down below, so I do have my primary View you just saw in my session. I also have this North Dock View. Again, kind of simplistic, but I did change the background color just so you can notice it. Now back at the root, or the home of the Perspective module, you can click on the cog icon at the bottom here or simply select the Perspective module in the project browser, they both take you back to the same location, we have this page configuration area here. Now you can see that I have, for the root page, or the home page here in my project, we do have my primary View configured. So this little work space over here allows you to add Views as a Docked View. So a Docked View again, a View that's kind of just placed or anchored to a particular edge of your session, that's not really a configuration you make to a View. Really any View can be docked potentially. So the way you dock a View to a particular edge is that you find that edge here, you click the little add button, so we'll add it to the northern edge here, then you get a little pop up here that allows you to pick from any of the Views available to this project. So I'll grab my north dock View and hit okay. So we have our primary for the center, we have potentially any docks around the edges, but I only have one dock configured right now, and it's that North Dock View. So let's save our project here. And hit save again, and if I bring my session back into view here, you can see that it now has that additional View docked to the northern edge. So now I can start putting buttons and navigation components at the top here. Now if we head back, there's this Shared Settings area. So if I head over to Shared Settings, you can see I get a similar interface; however, you don't get to specify a primary View, so the point of shared settings is that it allows you to dock Views for every page in this project. So, again if you're placing your navigation structure on a particular View that's docked and you don't want to have to manually add it to every page, you can do it under Shared Settings. So I do have an additional View here, this one named West Dock, I'm going to dock it on the western edge under Shared Settings. So I can hit the little Add button here, select West Dock, hit OK, and let's try that again. Let's go ahead and we'll save our project here. And let's save again, and let's head back to our session and just like last time, it just went ahead and automatically added that Dock for us. Now you kind of notice here, the two Docked Views are basically fighting over this corner. Right now the northern dock is taking up the entire width of the top portion of my session. And it's basically pushing this western dock out of the way. So that's actually something you can configure. So when we're over here, and I'll start in Shared Settings, you'll notice that there's that Corner Priority that I haven't talked about yet. This is basically what's determining what to do with the corners. So right now, it's set to top and bottom, so any Views that are docked to the top or the bottom take priority, and we're kind of showing you in the preview here. You can kind of see the left and the right are kind of being pushed down and have the little lines here. Now if I switch this to left-right, that means that the left and the right Docked Views will push the top and bottom Views out of the way. Now if we head back to one of my configured Pages, so if I go back to that first Page there, you can see that this also has its own Corner Priority. So I can on each individual Page have different Corner Priorities specified, or I can leave it with inherited, which means use the Shared Settings version of this Corner Priority property. So that should give you enough information to get started with the docks. In later videos we'll take a look at some additional settings.

                                    In this lesson, we'll take a look at some of the properties on Docked Views. So, we can see that I have my session here, I have a primary View, and then I have a Docked View here on the edge. Let's play around with some of the settings on this Docked View. So, I'm going to move my session out of the way. And we're at sort of the home of the Perspective module in the Designer, so, went over to the cog icon down here. We see our Page and I have this west Docked View. So, when you have a View that's docked to a particular edge of a Page, you can click on the name of the View and it shows you this little pop-up that allows you to configure the dock. So, let's work through a couple of these settings here. To start with, you can always change whatever View is associated with this dock here, just by clicking on the little drop-down. Now, you have the option to display it, so, the reason you'd want to hide this potentially, is that you can actually set it to On Demand or Auto, and then conditionally show the dock depending on some criteria. The easiest setting to use would be the Auto setting, which allows you to specify a breakpoint. So, we're saying when the session reaches this breakpoint, either show or hide this Docked View. And since we're here, let's also make this resizable, so I can go and resize the width of the Docked View if I want. Let's hit OK here, we'll save our project, save one more time, and let's head back to our session here. So, you can see, I can now resize the width here. I have a little bar I can simply grab and change the size or the width, in this case, of the left Docked View. But if I resize my session here, you'll see at a certain point, the dock automatically hides because I don't have enough room. Again, it's using that Auto Breakpoint property to determine whether or not I should show the dock. And of course, if my session gets wider, it comes back. Now, let's move this again out of the way, and we'll head back to the settings. I'll turn off resizable for right now, and let's add a handle. The handle's hidden right now, but if I click the drop-down, we can pick from one of the following options here. A handle is basically a little icon you can click on that happens to be next to the dock, and it allows you to show or hide the dock. Again, we'll hit OK, we will save our project, and if we head back to our session, you can see the handle. The handle can be repositioned. I can click on it and it hides the dock. I can click on it again and it comes back. Now, you see, when this Docked View appears, it's actually pushing my primary View over, so, it's actually resizing the primary View to make room for the Docked View. That's in another setting, so if we head back to the dock configurations here, the content drop-down here, so, the push is what's doing the pushing. If you wanted your dock to cover up the content, or basically be positioned in front of any components that are on the primary View, you can set this to cover and let's try that out. So, we'll hit OK again, we will save, and when we head back, you can see that the text actually kind of moved behind my dock. So, as I'm bringing the dock in and out of View here, you can see that it's just covering the content in the back. Now, notice the width here on this View. You probably guessed, but if I go back to the dock configuration, there is in fact a size property. So, the size here only dictates one dimension, so in this case, because I'm using a left dock, the size determines the width. So, if you're using a left or right dock, size determines the width. If you're configuring a top or bottom dock, this determines the height of the View. So, you can change the setting here, but I did want to point out real quick, if I go and I actually look at that Docked View, I'll click on it under Recently Modified Views. I configured the size of this View to kind of match a western dock here, but I didn't have to do that. Again, I could just resize this whole View to be whatever size I want, but because we're using it as a Docked View in one of our Pages, it's going to automatically be resized to fit as a dock. So, it doesn't matter that I changed this here. We save and I head back to my session, it's still the same width. So, you don't have to actually resize your Views to match your dock but from a designing perspective, sometimes that's useful.

                                    In this lesson, we'll take a look at passing parameters to Docked Views. So we can see I have a page configured, and this page does have a Docked View. Now when I click on the Docked View and you look at its settings here, you can see that there is this View Parameters area. This basically allows you to specify one or more params properties on the View that's docked. So in this case looking at my View named WestDock. So if I have any params category properties on that View, this interface allows me to pass some value in when we navigate to the page. Now we do have some other videos that look at Views and params properties, but just to kind of show you what I have set up so far, if I switch over to this WestDock View I created, I have this Label component. This Label component has a binding on the text property, that's pointed to, if I look at the WestDock or the actual View object itself, there is this params category of properties. So I created this one property called display, and because of the property bindings I've configured, I'm able to type something in over here, and you see it appear on my component. And, again, the actual mechanism here for property bindings, that's something we talk about in another video. So we see this is working alright. So, again, what I want to do is that when we switch to my Page, I want to pass a value to that display property. So the way you configure that, we'll go back to the dock configuration, and under View parameters I'll add an object member, and I defined the display property as just a value member, so I'll click on value. And for the name of the key there you want to type in the exact same name you typed on the View. So in my case, it was display. And then specify what value do you want to pass in here. So how about we just start with something simple? How about just "one"? Let's hit okay, here. We'll save our project. And now let's launch a session. So real quick, we can just right-click on our Page, we'll launch the URL. So you can see our Page opened up, and it actually went ahead and provided the text "one" for our display parameter. So now because we have all the bindings and everything set up, we could always come on back to our Designer. I could just add another Page real quick. We'll go ahead and leave that Page URL alone for now. I'll specify the primary View. We'll add our dock. I'm using that West Dock View I just showed you. We'll hit okay again. We'll come back up to the configuration on that dock, and let's add another value parameter. So, again, we'll pick value. This will be display, again, and this time we'll pass in something different about just the string "two"? So if we hit okay, and, again, we'll save our project because we added this new Page here. And when we try to launch this Page, so we'll right-click on it, we'll launch the URL, and get my session coming back up, we'll get a new tab, and it's showing you different text because of the page I'm on here. Now as a quick word on using these parameters with these Docked Views, if we head back to the configuration, we can see that the View parameters don't really have any sort of interface that allows you to create a binding, or otherwise make this value indirect. If you're trying to change the value on these Docked Views and these Pages in some way, you probably want to take a different approach. Maybe creating session props and then changing their values via script, or something to that effect.

                                    In this lesson, we will look at popups and perspective. From my designer, I have two views open. A main view with a button component and a popup view with a different color background and a label component. In perspective, any view can be used as a popup without the need for specific configuration changes. So what I will do, is configure the button in my main view to open the popup view as a popup. To do this, select the button, right click on the button, select configure events to open the event configuration window. From the events tree, select on action performed. Click on the plus icon next to the organized actions table and select popup. Under the select view dropdown, you will see a list of all the views available in your project. I select my popup view, click okay and save my changes.

**[01:02]** [01:02]
                                    What I have done here, is configured my button in my main view to use a component event to trigger the opening of my popup view. To test this, we simply head to tools, launch perspective, launch session. Once my session opens, I see my button in my main view up here. When I click it, I see that my popup opens as expected. Let's go back to our designer. What if we wanted to configure the popup to not be draggable and perhaps give it a title. To do this, we right click on our button, select configure events to bring up the event configuration window, under title, we will type my title, and under behavior, we will uncheck the draggable checkbox. Click okay and I save my changes. Now when I relaunched my session, and click on the button in the main view, we see that our popup now has the title of my title.

**[02:06]** [02:06]
                                    And when I try to drag the popup, I am no longer able to do so. As an alternative to using the popup action, I could have used a script action as well to open my popup via scripting. To do this, I right click on my button, select configure events to open the event configuration window, click on the plus icon next to the organized action table, I then select script to create a new script action. This will bring up a code editor where you can use the system.perspective.open popup scripting function to open your popup view.

                                    In this lesson, I will cover how to pass parameters to a popup view. In a previous lesson, we showed how a button can be configured with a component event to open a view as a popup. But what if in addition to opening the popup, we want to pass the popup some information as it is being opened? This is where popup parameter passing comes in handy. I am currently in my designer and I have a main window with a text field component and a button component. I also have a popup view with a slightly different background color and a label component. I will be configuring the button in my main view to take whatever I type in my text-field component, and pass it to the popup view. I will then display this text-field's value in the popup views label. The idea here is that when I pass a parameter to a view, whatever I am passing, will be available in the view through the view parameter.

**[01:00]** [01:00]
                                    This view parameter can then be used throughout the view. Usually, in indirect tag-bindings or something similar. For this popup view to be able to accept the parameter, we must first configure a view parameter. To do this, I go over to my project browser, and I select my popup view by left-clicking on it. On the right hand side of the designer, we see the perspective property editor showing all the properties of my selected view. At the bottom, we see a param section. I will click on the "add view parameter" plus button, to add a view parameter. I want my parameter to be a value so I select value. In this example, I will name the parameter "display." And I will save my parameter's value to "Hello World" Since I want my label on my popup to show the value I am passing to my popup's display parameter, I need to bind my labels text property to my display parameter. To do this, I select my label, then I click on the binding icon next to the labels text property on the perspective property editor.

**[02:03]** [02:03]
                                    This will bring up the binding editor window. Under binding type, I select property, and I head over to the property browser and drill down to "view", "Params", I select "display," since display is my view parameter, and click "OK." Once I click OK on the binding editor window, we see that the label now says: "Hello World!" This is because the label's text property is now bound to the view parameter display. Which means that anything I pass into the view's display parameter will be shown on my label. Now I have to configure the navigation action. To do so, let's go back to the main view. I then select and right-click on the button, select "configure events" to open the event configuration window, and from the events tree, I select "onActionPerformed" and add a popup action. Under the select view dropdown, you will see a list of all the available views in your project. I want to open my popup view, so I select "popup."

**[03:01]** [03:01]
                                    Since we want to pass a parameter to the popup view, I will click on the plus sign next to the parameters table. Notice how we have a display option. This is because, since we selected the popup view, ignition automatically knows what view parameters are available to us in the popup view we selected. Since we only have a display parameter, I select it, and it gets added to the parameter's table for the parameter value, I double-click on the property browser icon and drill down to "view," "root," "textfield," "props," I then select "text" and click "OK" What I have done is configured the text-field's text property to be passed to the popup view's display parameter as it is being opened. To finish the setup, I simply click "OK" to finish the event configuration and I save my changes. To test this, we simply launch a session, by pressing the "F10" shortcut key, and once my session opens, the button and text field in my main view will appear. If I type something in the text field and press the button, I see that the popup view opens and what I type gets displayed on the popups label. We can do this again by closing the popup, typing something else in the text-field, and pressing the button once more.
