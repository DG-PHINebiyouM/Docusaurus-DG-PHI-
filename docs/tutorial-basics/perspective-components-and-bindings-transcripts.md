                                    In this lesson, we'll take a closer look at components in the Perspective Module. Now we've seen from other videos here on Inductive University that when you have a View open in the Designer, you can head over to the Perspective Component Palette and drag and drop components directly on to your View. Notice that when I do this, wherever I drop the component, we place it so that the upper left hand corner is where the mouse cursor is pointing to. Once you have some components on your View, you can click on one of them and you'll see this selection box. So while it's selected I can then click and drag and move the component to a new position. Alternatively, I can use the arrow keys to move the component. Right now I'm holding the right arrow key, which moves our component one pixel at a time. I can also hold the Alt key and use the arrow keys to move 10 pixels at a time.

**[01:01]** [01:01]
                                    You'll see that we have these little resizing rectangles here, so whenever you have a component selected, you can simply click and drag on these to resize the component. If you want to drop your current selection, you can simply click on the background, which selects the nearest container you clicked on. In this case, it's selected the root container. If you're trying to select multiple components, there are a couple of ways. First, I could select a component, hold Ctrl and then click on another component I want to add to the selection. Now that I have multiple components selected, I can simply click and drag on one of them to move all of them. I can also resize them all together. And again to drop selection, I'll simply click on the background. Now similar to what I just showed you, we can also select something in the Project Browser, hold Ctrl and click on a different component to do the same thing. Now with the root container selected, I can click and drag to the side, and you'll notice it gives me a little box.

**[02:02]** [02:02]
                                    It gives you a dashed border if you drag to the left and it gives you a solid border if you drag to the right. Dragging up or down doesn't have any meaning, but left or right does. When you're creating this selection box by dragging to the left any component you touch with the box will be included in the selection when you let go. If I click back on the root container, and drag to the right, you won't see the same behavior here. Instead the box with the solid borders only selects a component if it's completely encased inside of the selection box. Now if I were to select a component, and then double click on it, you'll notice that the interface changes quite a bit. This is what's known as deep selection. Deep selection allows you to manipulate inner pieces of a component. Now on my tank here, that doesn't really make much sense, that doesn't really add anything to my component when I'm deep selecting. So I'm going to drop the deep selection by clicking on the background again.

**[03:00]** [03:00]
                                    And this makes a little bit more sense when we head back to the Component Palette and grab one of our containers. So if I grab a Tab container, for example, if I wanted to place a component inside of this container, I first need to deeply select. So I can double click on the Tab container. You'll notice that there's some visual changes to the component now that I've deeply selected. So if I wanted to add a component to one of these tabs here, we can come over the Component Palette and I can drag the component directly in to my container. So you can kind of see that that placed the tank inside of the tab container, as opposed to just at the root. So again deep selection is very useful when you start embedding these containers. I'll click on the background to drop the selection again. Now if you wanted to copy a component, you can simply select it and then right click, and you'll notice that we have cut, copy and paste as options. So we could copy and paste the component. There's also a duplicate option, which places a copy of the component on top of the original. In addition, you can select a component, or multiple components.

**[04:07]** [04:07]
                                    Hold the Ctrl key and then click and drag and you'll see that we get these little silhouettes here, so when I let go of the mouse button, it'll create duplicates of whatever components I had selected. Now I showed you that trick with multiple components selected, but really it works with single components as well. As does multi selecting components, right clicking and then copying, pasting or duplicating. So if I duplicate those two that were selected, I now have some additional tanks. And then of course if you need to delete some components, you can simply group them up, use our little multi selecting tricks, right click and then delete or use the delete key to remove those components. Now there's quite a bit more to components, for example we haven't really started talking about properties yet. There's a couple of items in the right click menu, such as the events and the scripting, but we'll talk about all of those in later videos. So hopefully that gives you some ideas on how to create, manipulate and select components.

                                    In this lesson, we'll take a closer look at properties on Perspective components. So when I have a component selected here, you can see that we have in the Property Editor, different categories. These categories allow us to organize the properties under a specific theme. Starting with the props properties here, these control how the component appears or behaves in the session. So if I were to, on this LED Display, change the value property, you'll see it appear on the component. Position properties dictate where the component is inside of its container. And they're also driven by the type of the container the component's in. The meta category shows common properties that all components have. Things like the name, or whether or not the component is visible. And then we have the custom category. Which is an ideal place for you to create your own properties. For example, if I click on the little plus icon here, I can add a new custom property, and I just need to pick a type. So if you wanted to add just a single property, you can select value, you'll see that it has a key and a value here for us. So if I replace the key here, that's effectively renaming the property to something else. And then I can change the value by typing over here. So if you want a string for the value you type a string, if you want a number, you type in a number. Now, for any of these properties here, if you right click on the name, you'll see a right click menu, with a number of options such as copying, pasting, or deleting. Now I wanted to show you if I duplicate this one property here, it will add an additional property down below, but names within a particular category, have to be unique. You'll also see that if I hover over this little icon, I get a couple of warnings, telling me about the duplicate keys. So in this case, I can just double click on the name of one of them, change the name to something else, and that clears the warning. Now if I need to add more properties here, and I don't want to duplicate, you'll notice that I can move my mouse cursor just above or below a particular property, that gives me the little plus icon again, or I can simply right click on one of these, and insert a new property. Now we have a couple of other types. You can see that there is an array down here, so if I create a new array property, and I'll give this one a name as well, you can see that I can start adding array properties with a plus icon down below. And they work the same otherwise, I can simply change the value by typing into the value field. Now I can also right click on a property, and under Structure, so not the Insert menu item, but you can see that there's actually in this case, an Array item, that has some sub items. It states Array here because this one property is an Array. If I were to right click on my prop, you can see that it shows it's a value property. This item here allows you to change the type of the property. So I could change my prop to an object instead. An object is similar to an array, except each item you add, allows you to specify a new key name. So I could create a parent property and then a bunch of sub properties, using either an Array, or if I wanted to reference the sub properties by name, an Object. And of course, if you need to get rid of a property, you can simply right click on the property, and select Delete. Now I've been showing you this right click menu from the custom category. But in Perspective, you can add and remove properties from any of these categories you want. We just recommend you use the custom category for your custom properties. So for example, I could come up to the props properties here, right click on value up here, and insert a new value type property. And you'll see that the key item appears down below. Now when you're adding a property to these other categories, they otherwise work the same as properties added to the custom category. So you have to have a unique name for each property, for example. However, you do want to be careful, if you were to remove some of the built in properties, so for example if I were to right click on value here, and delete it, it removes that functionality from the component, so you can see that my LED display, no longer is showing a value. Now this is easy enough to fix, I can simply click the undo button, or I can just add a new property here, type in value for the name of the property, and you can see that it starts working again. Now if you ever do delete any of these properties here, you can always check the component reference in the appendix of the Ignition User Manual, for a full list of available properties, as well as what they do.

**[00:00]** [00:00]
                                    By default, component properties and their values are saved with the project. Meaning that a property in a Perspective session will initialize with a value matching the last saved value in the designer. This is why you can create a label with a static text value, save your project, and then see the same text value in your session. These properties are considered to be persistent. Conversely, properties can be configured to not retain their values in a session. Meaning they will initialize without a value. These properties are non-persistent. The purpose of non-persistent properties is so that views do not start up with initial values that represent the last running values in the designer. In other words, bindings that generate very large objects, arrays or data sets will not have their values stored as configuration with a component. This is useful, because large objects can cause the same view size to be bloated by the size of large objects. Let's take a look at how persistent versus non-persistent properties work.

**[01:03]** [01:03]
                                    Here on the left, we have designer opened showing a perspective view with a gauge component on it. On the right, we have a perspective session launch for the view we have open on the designer. If I right-click on the gauge's value property, I see that the persistent flag is set to true. Properties are configured to persist by default, this means that if I set the gauge value to 50, when I save my changes, since the value property is set to be persistent, the session will display the last known value from the designer, which was 50. Let's go back to our designer, and change the gauge's value property to be non-persistent. Non-persistent properties are denoted by the transient icon to the right of the property's value in the property editor. After setting this property to not persist, saving my changes will cause the gauge in the session to show a value of zero which is the gauge's default value. This is because the property is non-persistent and the value of 50 was not retained in the session, and therefore the default value was used.

**[02:04]** [02:04]
                                    Another important aspect of persistence in properties, is that user created properties that are both user created and not flagged as persistent, will be lost once the view containing the property is closed in the designer. Regardless of whether or not the project was saved. Our gauge here has a user defined property named "myproperty". It is currently set to persist so if I close the view on the designer and reopen it, I see that the properties still exist. If I set it to not persist, and close the view, once the view reopens, we see that the property is now missing. This is also true for launching a session. As a user created property that is not persistent will not be present in the session itself. The one exception to this rule is if a binding was configured on the property. Binding configurations are always saved with a component, and will execute in the session.

**[03:00]** [03:00]
                                    The existence of a binding on a property will result in the property being recreated. If I configure a simple expression binding on a custom property like this, setting this bond property to not persist and closing the view, when the view is reopened, notice how the custom property was recreated due to its configured binding.

                                    In Perspective, images can be uploaded, referenced and embedded using the image components. In this lesson, we're going to talk about another kind of Perspective graphic known as an icon. Icons are designed to be small pre-configured images of scalable vector graphic, or SVG type. As their name suggests, icons are typically basic symbols designed to show a single graphical element that might be helpful in prompting specific user interactions. Icons are already incorporated into several of the more complex Perspective Components such as the map and many tree components, and can also stand alone on icon components. Although icons can not be added or removed using the image management utility, Perspective does come with a large library of them built-in and more can be added at any time. As I mentioned, we do have an icon component available. So if I head over to my Perspective Component palette, under Display, there's an icon component, which I'll drag into my view here.

**[01:05]** [01:05]
                                    The component starts with an icon ready to go. Remember that icons are ultimately SVG images, which means that stretching and scaling the component won't result in any pixelation. An icon can be arbitrarily small or arbitrarily large. As to the properties on the components, the first is a path property, which indicates which icon we should show. The magnifying glass on the right-hand side makes it easy to pick a different icon. So I'll click that. The first thing we see at the top of this menu is a dropdown, which allows us to choose an icon library. Different libraries will contain different icons, and it's possible to add our own libraries as well. Currently, we're looking at the material library, which contains the bulk of the pre-configured icons that come with Perspective. So how about I select this nice bed icon and double click? And that will configure our component to use that icon, which we can see is material slash hotel. Below the path property, we also have the ability to override the default color of the icon if desired, as well as configure some more standard stylings.

**[02:10]** [02:10]
                                    So now that we've seen a basic icon components, let's look at how we can add our own icons into the system. To do this, we actually need to modify the Ignition install files on the gateway. If I pull over my File Explorer here, we can see that the path we need to access is starting from the Ignition installed directory, data, modules, perspective, icons. Remember that icons are actually SVGs behind the scenes and to that end, each SVG file you see in the icons folder here is a different icon library. The name of the file will dictate what the library is called. From here, I have a file prepared that I can add into this folder. And dragging over from another monitor, we can see what this file looks like. This file contains two icons, one Red Circle, and one Blue Circle.

**[03:04]** [03:04]
                                    Similar sample files are available in the user manual. The important thing to note here is that each icon is enclosed in an SVG tag with two attributes defined. A viewBox attribute, specifies the natural dimensions of the graphic, which need to be large enough to fully enclose it and an ID attribute, which specifies the name of the icon. As long as our file has this same general structure, we shouldn't run into too much trouble using these icons in Perspective. So from there, I'm just going to use the File Explorer to drag this file into the icons folder, making sure that I have the requisite system permissions to do so. And with that, after a Designer restart, we'll be able to use our new icons in perspective development. So as we've seen, icons could be a great approach to simple and custom graphics and symbols in Perspective.

**[00:00]** [00:00]
                                    In this lesson, we'll talk about images in the Perspective Module. If you're familiar with Vision, you know that you can go up to the Tools menu and open up Image Management. And if you're unfamiliar with this tool, we simply store these images on the gateway, but you have access to them here. You also have some built-in images when you first install Ignition. But of course, there's an upload button here, so you can add images if you need to. The supported types are listed down below. Now, in this case, we're going to head over to the built-in. So I'll start double clicking. I'll go to this Agitator directory, I'll double click again, and I'm going to use this first agitator here. So I'm going to right click and copy the path to it, which places the path to this image in image management into my system clipboard. So copy the path here and I'm done with image management. I'm simply going to close this. Now to get that image onto my view, we'll primarily be using the image component.

**[01:04]** [01:04]
                                    So if I head over to the Prospective Component pallet under Display, there's an image component, which I'll drag onto my view. And then to show the image, we need to update the source property here. Now you can see from the tool tip, we need an image URI. We'll talk about that a little bit later though. So right now to use the image management stuff, I simply need to change the value of source. So if I head over to the value, I'll right click and I'll paste. It'll paste the path to that image, but you won't see the image yet. To access images in image management, you need to make a slight modification to this path. I'll click back into the source field here. I move my text cursor all the way over to the left, and then you type slash systems, slash images, and then one more slash, and you can see that the image appears right away. Now at this moment in time, you need to type system slash images which may change in the future. Always consult the user manual for more information. Now, while I have this image component here, I will notice that as I resize the component, the image doesn't stretch with it.

**[02:07]** [02:07]
                                    And that's mostly due to these fit properties here, specifically mode. The mode property determines whether or not we should resize the image. So if I click the little drop down here, I could set it to fill, which will cause the image to fill the entirety of the component. Now, again, we're working with these rasterized images, which don't necessarily handle being resized too well. I think I'll set this back to none and use just the original size. Now let's grab another image component. So we'll head back to the Prospective Component pallet. And again, back under Display, I'll grab an image and throw that onto my view. Now, from the tool tip we saw earlier here, source allows us to grab a URI. And again, we're dealing with a web based solution here. So if I can grab some sort of web address, we can simply point the component to an image over the network somewhere. Now I'm going to move my designer out of the way here and head over to one of my favorite websites.

**[03:06]** [03:06]
                                    If you have an image stored or available somewhere such as this one at the top, I can right click on it and I can copy the image address to it. So again, just to kind of show you if I go to a different tab and I just kind of paste that in there, we'll hit Enter and you kind of see that it shows the image as well as the path to it. We can actually use that URL up there inside of our components. So now that I've showed you how to steal these images, let's go ahead. We'll head back to our designer and I have my image component, my new one selected. I can simply click into this field. We'll go ahead and we'll actually, we'll right click, we'll paste. And you can see the image is now available inside of the component. As a closing statement, it may or may not seem obvious, but always respect applicable copyright laws when using images you find online.

                                    In previous lessons, we looked at how we can work with images and perspective using the image management utility and the image components. In this lesson, we're going to look at a straightforward mechanic that can make working with images even simpler. Namely in perspective, we have the ability to drag and drop images directly into a view. So to demonstrate, I have my designer open here and we're looking at a view I've created. On the side, I'm going to pull up my file explorer off another monitor, and I'll find the image I'd like to use in my project. And then just click, drag and drop that image into my view like so. On drop, a link image dialog will appear which will allow me to decide how to use this image in my view. it's worth noting that this technique will work for any supported image type. Meaning SVG, GIF, JPG, JPG, and PNG images. Now once this dialogue is up, we have two choices for how we want to incorporate this image into our view represented by the two radio buttons at the top.

**[01:08]** [01:08]
                                    The first choice is save and link which will save the image in the image management utility, then generate an image component linked to that image automatically. This effectively automates some of the image component work we've seen in previous lessons and allows us to use an image from our files system in a single step. All we need to do is tell Ignition where the image should be stored under image management. I'm fine saving my image in the root directory here with the default name as specified. So I'll just click upload to initiate the save and link process. Immediately, we'll see the image generated in our view and with it selected, we'll see that the source property for the image has been tied to the path of the image in our image management structure. So in effect, this method eliminates the need to set up the image component ourselves. However, if we want to modify how the image is displayed, we can modify the properties of the generated image component to do so. Now there was another radio button in that interface.

**[02:04]** [02:04]
                                    So I'm going to pull up my file explorer one more time. And this time drag in my second file like so, and this time I'm going to choose the embed image option. This option allows us to save the image directly as part of the view. This can be a useful feature when you want the image to be directly tied into the views configuration, which in some situations can be a bit simpler. So I'll go ahead and click embed here. For this embedded image we still use the image component so we have all the customization options the component allows, but the source property contains the actual image data rather than URL. It's worth mentioning that there are a couple of downsides to this approach. For one, the image can not be used elsewhere with an ignition without being imported again. So if some future structure required the image we'd have to duplicate this work. Additionally, storing an image as part of a view can cause degraded performance. Particularly when the image is larger than a hundred kilobytes or so. So with that said, however you opt to add an image into your view dragging and dropping files directly is a quick and easy approach.

                                    In this lesson, we'll take a look at the Perspective video player component. The component was designed to either play video files or stream a live feed. You can see I have a web browser in front of me with a running session. And inside of that session, there is a video player component. If I play the video here, we can see it in action. It has a lot of the sort of common features and functionality you'd come to expect in a web-based video player. I can pause the video here, I can seek forward to certain timestamps or points in the video. There are some volume control, there's some playback speed controls, there's even a right click menu here with a couple of additional options. Now let's switch over to the designer and take a look at how this component is configured. So I have that same view you just saw the session and I'm going to go and I have my video player component here. If we take a look at the property editor. The source property is arguably the most important property. Source expects a path leading to a video that the component can play. If you needed to configure this component to show a live feed, say you have some camera system and you just want to show the output from the cameras on this component, all you need to do is toggle the liveFeed, and then set the source to the URL of the feed. I'm not using a live feed right now. So I'll set that back to false. And looking at some of the other properties here that are available when you're not using a live feed, we'll play with poster in a moment, but it basically allows you to show an image on the component before the video starts playing. The autohideControls property here, will hide the controls on the component. If I were to enter preview mode here, and I hover my mouse cursor on top of the video player component, you'll notice that the control panel then pops up. So this is ideal in cases where you don't necessarily want the controls to always be visible. Say you're playing the video on a dashboard somewhere or in some kiosk. Under the controls object here, we have a bunch of properties that allow you to control and manipulate the component. So if you wanted to play the video or change the playback rate, you could do that from these controls here, instead of having the user directly interact with the component. The status object here has a bunch of properties that report the current state of the component. So whether or not a video is playing, if data has been loaded into the component, the video is over and a couple of other items. And then we have two style objects, one specifically for the control bar at the bottom and then one for the rest of the component. Now, you've probably noticed, I have an error message here, telling me that the files is not valid. But a moment ago, if I were to switch back to my browser, you notice the video is playing just fine here. What you're seeing here is a video encoding issue that a fair number of you may run into. In short, the browser we're using here in the designer to render your components, has support for some video codecs, but not all. Specifically, the video I'm using in the player here, used H.264 encoding, which isn't currently included, which is why I'm seeing the error in the designer, but I don't see it in the session in my web browser, because the web browser happens to have support for that type of encoding. So it's always a good idea to just test out the component in a browser. If you wanted to see more information, take a look at the video player page in the user manual in the appendix. Now looking back up at the source property here, this could actually be a fully qualified URL that leads to some video that's hosted on some other platform. What I'm actually doing here is I'm actually using web dev to provide a path that the video player here can use. So if you have the MP4 or if you have the video file that you wanted to show and you didn't want to host it on a third party platform of some sort, you could have your gateway host the video. I'm not going to spend too much time talking about web dev, we do have some content in the user manual if you're curious, but I didn't want to show you how I set this up. So I'm going to switch over to the Web Dev workspace in the project browser. And I'm going to right click on Web Dev, I'm going to create a new file resource, which just allows me to pass in a file, and then the gateway will make that file available. I'm going to browse and I actually have this TestVideo, I wanted to make available. So I'll click Open. And I'll use the suggested name here. We'll just click on Create Resource. And now my TestVideo sets as a resource. You can see that my XY Chart video that I showed you earlier is already here. And here's a little logo SVG. This is something I'm going to use for the poster property that we talked about a moment ago. Now all I need to get this up and running because my project that I'm using the video player on is the same gateway that this web dev resource, this TestVideo lives on. I'm going to right click on TestVideo, and I'm going to copy the mounted path, which will give me a partial path that just leads to this particular file. Now we can head back to the Perspective workspace and I'll switch over to my view, I already have it open. And I'm going to actually, I'm just going to duplicate this component here, I'm going to hold Control, left click and drag. And I'm going to replace the source property here. And actually, I'll just right click and paste, which is going to set the source to that TestVideo, I just created a file resource for. And off camera here, I do have a path that leads to that SVG I talked about a moment ago. I'm just going to paste that into the poster property. And you can see because it's an SVG, it's already working. Now I use the same encoding on both videos, which is why you're seeing the file not valid error here. But let's test it out. So let's save our project. And I'll switch back to my browser here. You can see I now have two video player components to see the posters up and running. And just so you don't have to hear the jingle a second time, I'm going to reduce the volume. We'll play it and you can see it's up and running. And that's it. That's all you really need to know to get started with the video player component. But like I said earlier, there's more information in the user manual. If you're curious, take a look at the video player component for the Perspective module in the appendix.

                                    In this lesson, we'll take a look at the perspective modules PDF viewer components. This component was designed to render PDFs directly in a prospective session. Starting off in the designer, I have an empty container here. I'm going to head over to the component palette and under the display category, we do have our PDF viewer component, which I'll just drag into the container here. We can see that we have an initial PDF that the component is showing but of course, you'll probably want to change this to something else. The way you'll change that is with the source property. Now, the source property needs a path that leads to a PDF. And this path can be a number of different things, it could be a URL to a PDF that's hosted somewhere or it could just lead to the bytes that make up the PDF. Now, if you have the PDF just sitting on the gateways file system, an easy way to get that PDF into this component would be by creating a Web Dev resource. I'm not going to go to in depth on what Web Dev is, we do have some content in the user manual if you're curious, but just to get this component up and running, I'm going to switch over to the Web Dev workspace. I'm going to right click on Web Dev and I'm going to create a new file resource, which is simply going to allow me to pass in a file and the gateway will make that file available at a certain path. So, I'll create the new file resource. I have this best practices PDF, I would like to use, so I'm going to hit open. I'll use the name that it suggest here and I'll create the new resource. And now we have the new resource. So the next step to get the path that I need, I'm going to right click on this resource and I'm going to copy the mounted path. Which places that path I need in these systems clipboard. Now, we're ready to go back to the perspective workspace. I'll switch back to the view I had open and I'll select the PDF viewer component again. Now, we can just replace the source property here. So, I'll just backspace and actually I'll just right-click and paste in here. And you can see it's now rendering my PDF. Now as far as available properties on the PDF viewer component, you can tell it's pretty simplistic. Page just represents the currently shown page in the PDF, so of course, if you wanted to change this, you simply change the value of page and it will switch which page is rendered on the component. Page count here is a read-only property just represents the maximum number of pages on the component. And then show page number here as well do you want us to show the current out of the maximum number of pages in the PDF on the component or not. Now if you wanted this component to be interactable from a session, that's just a matter of placing some components on the view here and then changing or poking up a binding that interacts with the page count here. So for example, I could head over to the component palette and under the input category of properties here I have a couple of options but I think I'll just select the slider which I'll place on the view here. Now when we're clicking and dragging the dial on the slider the value here changes. So of course, I could switch back to my PDF viewer component and then bind the page property to the value that's on the slider. So, I'll click on my PDF viewer component here and for the page property here, I'll click the little binding icon, I'll select a property type, we'll browse for properties here, we'll find our slider components under props here, I'll grab the value, will click okay, and we can see that it's going to start with a value of zero which of course isn't really going to be a great experience on my PDF viewer here. So, maybe I could go back to the slider components and just set the minimum to a value of one so we start on page one. And of course, we could bind the maximum property on the slider to the page count that's on the PDF viewer so that way we always cap out at the maximum number of pages but you get the idea. So, now I can go into preview mode here and I can move my dial and now I can interact with the component. And of course, this works from the session. And that's really it for the PDF viewer component. It's pretty simplistic, but it's ideal to use if you have any sort of PDFs you need to show in a perspective session.

                                    In this lesson we'll take a look at Tag Bindings as well as bindings in general in the Perspective module. We see bindings used in many places in Ignition. A binding allows you to take the value of a property and automatically update it based on the value of something else. The most common type of binding would be a Tag Binding. So when we're in our Designer and we're looking at a View here, I can take any one of my tags and I can drag and drop it onto my View. We get an option of available components that we want to create, and then when we create these components, they'll be bound to the tag that we just dragged on. So in this case I can create an LED Display, and you can see that the value on this component is now tied to this one tag value. So as the tag changes, the value on the component changes. While I have the component selected, we can see over here that our value property has this little blue icon next to it. That means that this one property is bound to something. There's a binding to something on there. Now if I want to examine it I can simply click on the icon and it'll show me the type of binding. So we can see that it has a Tag Binding selected, it's using a direct mode, there's some other settings, we'll talk about those in later videos, but we can see that it's pointed to Tower 1/Fan Speed, which is if you look down in the Tag Browser Tower 1, and then the Fan Speed tag inside of there. So if I close this window here. Now if you were to try that manually, so say I were to go to the Component Palette, and how about I grab a Numeric Entry Field here, I'll drag this onto my View, and if we look at the Property Editor, notice that we have this little gutter here on the left hand side. And as I move my mouse cursor up and down the property list, there's a little icon that moves. Again that's the binding icon, but because none of these properties have a binding on them it's not always visible. So I could set up a binding on the value property here. We'll do it manually this time. I'll click on the binding icon for the value property, and we'll get our binding window back. Now just a quick note here, when you're looking at the Title bar it does tell you the name of the component that this binding is going to be attached to, it tells you the category of properties, so under the props category here, and then the name of the property that we're going to bind to. So now that we know we're going to place a binding on the value of this Numeric Entry Field, I need to pick a type. So if I were to manually set up a Tag Binding I can select the tag type, it's set to Direct, and then I need to specify a tag path here. Now don't type here, it's much easier to just use this little tag button here to browse a tag path. So I can click on the tag button there and then we have all of our tags available. I'll go down to my tags folder. In this case I have a little Memory Tag, that's just sort of at the root of that tag provider there so I'll select my Memory Tag. Now I can keep drilling down on my tags to get some of the sub-properties here. You'll notice that value is an available sub property on your tags. You can grab this and this will get you the value of the tag, but in most places in Ignition here if you simply grab the tag that usually gets you the value as well so either one of these would be just fine. So I'll grab my new tag here and I'll click okay. And we can see from the binding preview here that the value in the preview is matching the value on our tag. So we'll hit OK. So now we should see that if I come over to this Memory Tag here, if I try to change the value on it it should change the value on the component. Now you'll want to make sure that your Designer is in read/write mode here, so we can always go to Project, and change the Comm Mode to read/write. We'll go ahead and I'll double click on the value type something in, hit enter, and we'll see it update. Now if I try to put my Designer into preview mode here if I try to change the value here, on the control or on the component, so if I were to put a one in there and hit enter, we'll see the value on the component changes. However, the value on the tag doesn't change. The reason for this is because Tag Bindings, really all bindings by default, are unidirectional, which means the flow of data really only goes in one way. So in this case when we have a property and it's bound to something else the flow of data always goes from that something else, in this case a tag, to the component. It doesn't flow in the other direction. If I make a change on the component it's not going to go back to the tag unless I make the binding bi-directional. So if I were to, I'm going to take my Designer back into design mode here, and with my Numeric Entry Field selected I'll go back to the binding here and we can see all of our settings are still there. There's this little Bidirectional check box. Now, not all of the binding types have the Bidirectional check box. But for the ones that do you can simply enable it and then this will allow you to synchronize the value on the property with whatever you're binding to so in this case the tag. So if I hit OK here, again I can go back into preview mode, or I can launch a session if I wanted to as well. We can go ahead and try that again. I'll put a little 2 here, we'll hit enter, you see that the value on the component changes and that got pushed back to the tag. Now for the last little part here again I'm going to take my Designer back into design mode here. I'm going to select my LED Display, now say I wanted to remove a binding. I didn't want this component to automatically update based on the tag anymore. So I could go ahead and examine the binding on the property here. So I can click the binding icon again. And in the lower left hand corner there's a Remove Binding button. I did that a little fast here, so if I go back to the Tag Binding here there's a Remove Binding button. I can simply click on that, hit OK, you'll notice that my component is no longer automatically updating. The tag's still changing value, the component's showing the last known value that the binding provided to it but they're no longer synchronized. So hopefully that gives you a good idea of how the binding system in Perspective works as well as how Tag Bindings work. I did show you the whole process of manually setting up the bindings but in all honesty it's much easier to simply start dragging and dropping your components onto the View.

                                    In this lesson, we'll take a look at Indirect Tag Bindings in Perspective. So we can see that I have a couple of components here. I have an LED Display and a Numeric Entry Field. The LED Display we can see has a binding on the value property and it's simply using a direct Tag Binding to the Tower 1/Fan Speed tag, so Tower 1, Fan Speed. Right, and the values do seem to match up. So what I'd like to do, is I would like to be able to type in a number here inside of this Numeric Entry Field and then change the tower, or part of the path here, that this LED Display is using. So type a 2 into here, and then that way this binding will look at Tower 2. So if you wanted to be able to change your Tag Bindings on the fly like this, you could use an Indirect Tag Binding instead of a direct. Notice as I kind of switch around here, it does actually maintain the tag path for us, so if I even add a couple spaces, if I switch over, it does actually remember, or maintain those. Now if I didn't have any path here to start with, if this was just a blank path, there's a little tag button on the right you can click on which will allow you to browse through and see all of your tags. So we can either go to the Tags folder here to get the project default tags, otherwise I can go down to all providers and grab from any of my tag providers. So, in this case I'll just go down here to Tower 1, grab the Fan Speed and hit OK. And you can see that it does actually specify the tag provider in the path. Now we don't really need it for this example, just showing you that you can do that if you need to. So what I would like to do for this example, I want to replace the 1 there with whatever I have typed inside of that component. To accomplish this, I can delete part of my path, so I can get rid of the number 1 here and if I hit the little { } icon here on the right, this allows you to browse for a property, either inside of the View, or somewhere inside of the session. So I know my Numeric Entry Field is inside of my View, so we can go down to our View, we can go down to the root container, we can find our Numeric Entry Field, we'll go to the props category because I know the value on the Numeric Entry Field is under the props category, and I'll grab the value and hit OK. So we do see the curly brackets notation, you'll see this all over the place in Ignition, basically means that that is a reference to some property or something else somewhere. And down below we can actually see what values map to. So value is mapped to this other component that happens to be inside of the View, more specifically, the value property under the props category. So to take a moment to explain, we're still just building a tag path here. The big difference between this and the direct is that I'm just putting a property reference inside of the tag path. So now we can actually change which tag we're bound to. I'll hit OK and we see that my Numeric Entry Field has a 2 in it, which means that the LED is looking at the Tower 2 Fan Speed. If I were to select my Numeric Entry Field, and if I were to change that 2 to a 1, you can see that we switched, now I'm looking at the Fan Speed that's inside of Tower 1. Right, so now I have this one little component here that allows me to change the Tag Binding that's on the LED Display. Now, one more piece of information that you should be aware of, I'm going to select my LED Display here, and we're going to go back to the binding on the value property. So when you're working with these tag paths and references, of course you can add multiple, so I can always just hit the little property reference button and add more properties here and really just fill up this whole table. I can also, when I'm looking at this property column for any one of these references, there's this little fbutton you can click on. When you click on it, it gives you this little expression area, so you can write an Ignition expression that allows you to basically change the value of this one reference before we place it into the path. So this is another opportunity for you to maybe use some of our built in expression functions. So we can use some of the logic functions, we can add if statements, or switch statements. We can also just take other properties, and then you can concatenate what the value of this one reference should be. So in most cases this might be overkill, but it's nice because it allows you to customize this even further. We can make this one reference a bit more interesting. So hopefully that gives you a good idea about what an Indirect Tag Binding is and how it works.

                                    In this lesson, we'll take a look at Property Bindings on Perspective components. So in my View here, we'll create a couple of components, I'll grab a Numeric Entry Field and how about a Slider and for the Slider here, let's also turn on the labels. I would like to create a binding from one of these components to the other so that when the value property on, say, the Slider changes I also want the value property on the Numeric Entry Field to update. So, I'll select the Numeric Entry Field, I'll head over to the property editor and for the value property, we'll place a binding on this one property. I'll click the binding icon. We'll see the binding window up here. For the binding type, I'll select a property type. Property Bindings are fantastic when you want to bind the value of a property to the value of another property that exists on the View somewhere. From here, we need to specify the path to the property we want to bind to, however, don't worry about typing anything into here, there's a little button on the right-hand side that allows you to browse all of the available properties in the View and it will type out the syntax for you. So you can see that I can grab anything inside of the View and we can also grab some stuff that's sitting in the session. So, we know that in my View, in the root container here, we have our Numeric Entry Field, but we also have our Slider if I were to expand the Slider here, we can go down to the props category, and we can see that I have my value property. So, with that selected, I'll hit OK and you can see that it typed out the notation for us. So, again, we don't really need to know what all those characters mean, they're in the User Manual if you're curious, but the little button there helps build the path for us. We can see in the binding preview down below, we're no longer getting an error, so I'll hit OK. You can see that we have a non-null value here so if I put the Designer into preview mode, we'll see the value on the Numeric Entry Field change as I click on the dial here and start dragging it around. So, whenever there's a value change on the Slider, we're simply pushing that over to the value property on the Numeric Entry Field. By default, the flow of data on this binding really only goes in one direction. If I try to change the number on the Numeric Entry Field we see that the Slider doesn't update. Now, if you did need to synchronize the values, so if I wanted to change the value on the Numeric Entry Field and have it push back to the Slider, that's very easy to do, you just need to make the binding Bidirectional. So, if I click on the binding icon again, for our Numeric Entry Field, we can see that our old binding is still there. I can hit the Bidirectional check box and hit OK and I did that while I was still in preview mode so we're ready to test this out. So I can click here, I can try to type something in and hit enter. You'll see that the dial on the Slider jumps and of course if I grab the dial, start moving it, we're changing the value on the Numeric Entry Field still.

                                    In this lesson, we'll take a look at the Expression Binding type in Perspective. If you've seen the Expression language before, then you already know how it works, but it's important to know you can use Expression Bindings with Perspective components. So here I have a couple of Ramp tags here and a couple of LED Displays. I would like to add the value of two tags here, we'll go with Ramp0 and Ramp9, I suppose. And then whatever the sum of those two tags are, I want to show on this one LED Display. So we'll do a little bit of math. So I'll select this LED Display for the value property here. We'll click on the binding icon, and I'll select an Expression type. So now we can write our Expression. We'll grab a couple of tag references and then just add them together. If you look on the right-hand side here, there's a bunch of options. You can also resize the panel if you'd like. I'll click on the tag button here and browse. I'll start looking in my Tags folder. We'll go down into our Ramps folder, and I'll grab Ramp0 and hit OK. So we see we have a tag reference that's wrapped up in the curly brackets there. So we have one tag, but let's add a little bit more here. So I'll make sure my text cursor is at the end of that little tag reference there, and you can see that there is a little plus equal sign here. This shows you all of the available operators. So I'll go down to Mathematical, we'll pick Addition, and then I'll grab another tag. So in this case, I'll go back to the tag button, and we'll grab that Ramp9 and hit OK. And you can see in the preview down below, it's already adding the two together. So I'll hit OK, and there we are. Now let's expand upon this a bit more. We do have functions in the Expression language. So how about we take this LED Display and we show the value of this Memory Tag down here, which has a negative number, let's show the absolute value on the LED. Again, we'll find the value property. I'll click the binding icon. We'll do an Expression Binding again. We'll head over and we'll take a look at this fbutton, or this functions button, and it gives you a list of all the functions in the Expression language. We'll head over to math because we have the absolute, or abs function, and we simply need to provide it a number. So, in this case, the number would be the value on our Memory Tag. So I'll click on the function, and you'll see the function is written for us. So now we'll go ahead and place a reference to our Memory Tag. I'll click on the tag button again. We'll go to our Tags folder. We'll grab our Memory Tag and hit OK. And we just need to close that function off there. So I'll put a closing parenthesis at the end, and you can see that it's giving us the absolute value in the preview. We'll hit OK, and there we are. Now there's quite a bit more you can do with the Expression Bindings here. If I head back to the binding window, you can do stuff that doesn't even have anything to do with a tag. So if you wanted to return a date, concatenate some strings, whatever, there's a bunch of options here. But the main takeaway is that you can apply these Expressions to properties in Perspective.

**[00:00]** [00:00]
                                    In this lesson, we'll take a look at Query Bindings in the Perspective Module. We can see that I have a Table component here and I would like to place a Named Query Binding on this component. So we know the data property here on the Table allows us to populate the Table with data. So we'll hit the binding icon here. We'll select the query type, and then we need to select a Named Query. Now that Query Binding type, in Perspective, only uses Named Queries. You can't type a query here from this interface. Instead you have to go and create a Named Query. For more information on that, take a look at some of the videos we have on Named Queries. If you have some created, you can click on the little icon over here and you'll see a list of all the available Named Queries in the project. For our first example, I'll select this one called, Simple Query, hit select. You can see a preview of it over here, it's simply returning the string, Hello IU. Now, if I hit OK here, you can see on my Table, it's showing me the results. Now, if I go back to my binding here, we can see that the return format is set to auto. So depending on how you've configured your Named Query, this could return a dataset, or it could return a scalar value. This drop-down here allows you to override and modify the format. So my Named Query is just a standard query type which means it's returning a dataset. Now that's try this same Named Query, but on a different component. So I won't use the Table this time, we'll use a Label. I head over to the Component Palette, go to the Display category, and I can grab a Label Component, drag that onto my View somewhere. And let's try that again. So for this component here, we'll find the text property, we'll click the binding icon. Again, we'll click the query type. I'll go ahead and I'll browse, and I'll grab that simple query one more time here. Now, again, it's trying to bring back a dataset. So if I hit apply and move this out of the way here, it's not really super useful how it's being presented, so what we could do instead, is change the return format to scalar. Scalar will return the value that's in the first row and the first column. If I switch this to scalar, it will automatically pull the value out of the dataset, so my query's only returning a single value, so it really makes sense for my return format, in this case, be set to scalar. I'll press OK and you can see our Label is showing the results of the query in a more user friendly format. Now, I want to do something a little bit more interesting, I want to use some parameters with the Named Queries here on my Table. So, first of all, I'm going to come back to the Component Palette here. And under the Input category, let's go ahead and we'll grab a Text Field component. We'll drag that onto my View somewhere. For this next example, I want to type a number into the Text Field and then have a Named Query on the Table, use the value I typed as a parameter. So we'll select the Table. We'll go back to the binding on the data property. Let's change this Named Query, here. I do have an Equipment query we can take a look at, which does actually use a parameter and we see it defined up above here. So I could just type in a value, so I could just type in the number 1 here and hit enter, or we could hit the little functions or fbutton here. And then type in an Expression. So in this case here, how about we reference the text property under the props category on my Text Field. So, we'll grab a little property reference here. We'll go down and we'll find our Text Field component. We'll expand that. We'll go to the props category of properties. We'll grab the text property and hit OK. We'll hit OK one more time. I'll press enter, and you can see that it commits the value in the field there, so now we're set. We'll press OK on the binding window here. And you can see my Table has an empty dataset because I haven't typed anything into the Text Field. Let's go into preview mode, I'll type something in, and we can see the results up above. If I type in a different number, I get a different set of results. Now the last thing you might want to be aware of with these bindings here is that, by default, they don't poll. So these bindings are turned off by default. They only fire when the View opens. So what you could do is you could turn on polling down below then type in the number of seconds you want this binding to poll at. So hopefully you have a good idea how these Query Bindings work in Perspective. Again, I made a lot of assumptions with Named Queries so if you haven't learned about those yet, take a look at some of the Named Query videos.

**00:07** [ 00:07 ]
                                    In this lesson we'll talk about the tag history binding in the perspective module. I have a view here, I have a bunch of tags that have tag history enabled. I would like to show the records from these tags on a table in my view. We'll head over to the component palette here and under the display category I'll grab a table component and drop that on my view somewhere. Now, for this lesson here I'm not going to spend a lot of time talking about the various settings that are on the table. Instead, I'm just going to focus on the binding. We'll talk about the table in later videos.

**00:42** [ 00:42 ]
                                    To populate the table with any data, we need to place a binding on the data property here. I'll click on the binding icon and that brings up our binding interface. From the binding types on the left, we'll select the tag history binding. You can see the various settings for it here. Now, in the very least you need to specify a time range, as well as pick some tag paths. For the time range it defaults to real time, and then one hour. So, saying for the last one hour, grab the records for these tags down below. You can change this to historical which allows you to specify a start date and an end date. It uses expressions here for these fields. You can click on the little f(x) or the function button here. It gives you a little editor, allows you pick tags in your system, allows you to pick properties that are available in the view so you can put some date time pickers on the view and then have this expression reference the date that the user picked.

**01:42** [ 01:42 ]
                                    Now I'm not going to make any changes on these here. I'll just hit cancel for right now and let's head back for our time range, let's go back to real time. I think I'll just specify the last one minute's worth of data to keep it kind of brief. We then need to specify some tag paths so we'll come over here and hit the little tag button on the right and then start browsing for any tags that we want to try and query the tag history system for. I'll go to my tags folder here. I know that I have my historical tags in my sine folder here so I'll grab sine zero, hit okay and just for fun let's add one more, hit the tag button again, I'll grab sine one and hit okay. We'll use these two tags here.

**02:24** [ 02:24 ]
                                    Now you can see that there's an aggregation mode column, it's set to default so it's using the default aggregation mode for the binding which just happens to be set at min max. You can for each one of these items just click on the individual field and pick a different aggregation mode. We'll leave those with the default for right now. I'll just hit okay and there you go. You can see that we have a time stamp column and then we have an individual column for each one of my tags. Let's go back to the binding. You probably saw earlier in the binding preview our data set is showing 100 rows. That's not a coincidence, it's 100 because the query mode is currently set to point count with a value of 100. Regardless of your range here this binding will always return 100 data points. Again, the tag history system likes to aggregate and interpolate values and create its own time slices.

**03:19** [ 03:19 ]
                                    We're still looking at your time range to figure out how far back to query for. Then we take those results and give you an interpolated data set. Now if you didn't like that for some reason you can change the query mode to one of the other options. For example we can use as stored which simply returns the values that we recorded within this time range. I have two tags that are both recording values once a second, you can see down below we have 119 rows. It looks like one of my tags didn't exceed its deadband threshold for its history settings. You can see that this query mode better represents the records we actually recorded. Now if we head back up above to the return format here you do have options.

**04:00** [ 04:00 ]
                                    Right now you're looking at the wide format. Each tag path gets its own dedicated column. If you had a large number of tag paths defined in this binding, the columns here would be incredibly narrow so you could instead use a tall format which instead stacks all of the tags under one column. You can also select calculations here which allows you to apply even more calculations for each one of your tag paths. You can actually pick a whole bunch of aggregations and we'll apply all of them to whatever tag paths you specify. Now heading back to wide just to show you all of those options over here, right now this binding doesn't pole. I could enable polling and then specify a certain amount of time. I could say hey, every ten seconds re-trigger this binding and get me the most recent results.

**04:49** [ 04:49 ]
                                    The last thing I'm going to talk about here is this alias column. Now it make look a little bit different than initially, that's because I'm back to as stored. If I go back to point count you can still see that alias is there. Basically what alias does is it allows you to change the header that's being returned by the binding. Now for the table this is important because it basically changes the header. Instead of saying sine zero at the top maybe this is a pressure reading of some sort. I could type that in, hit enter and then when I hit okay here you can see that it has an updated header. That should be enough to get you started with this binding. As you can see there are a ton of options for the binding. For more information take a look in the user manual as we'll describe what each of the options do.

                                    Bindings in Perspective features an overlay system. This overlay system lets you know when there is a problem with one of the bindings. So, here we see I have a Label, which has a little red border and a little exclamation mark. That's part of the overlay system. So if I select the component, we can see that the text property has a little red background. If I hover over this little icon, it tells me that there's a configuration error. So, whenever there's a problem with one of these bindings here, we'll simply place an overlay on the component. Now, if I were to select that component and take a look at the binding here, I'm using a tag binding to Tower One/PH, and we can see that it's still giving me an error configuration. So, there's something wrong with this tag. Now, of course if I look in the Tag Browser, we can see under Tower 1 that yeah, that PH tag also has a configuration error. So, really the problem in this case is with the tag, but the overlay system is letting me know. So, to fix this, I don't actually have to change the binding here, I just need to address my tag. So, I can close this window here, and if I double click on that PH tag, I intentionally changed the OPC item path to have an extra character at the end here, which, if we were to delete, I can hit OK, and you'll see everything starting to run again, and I no longer have the overlay on the component. Now, if we were to look at this in a larger scale, say I wanted to see what happens when I lose connection with a device or basically get a bunch of overlays at the same time. So, I'm going to head over, and I'm actually going to disable my OPC UA server. And you'll see in just a moment here, because again, all of these tags have unknown quality, they're using the last known value, my components also get some overlays. So, we'll go ahead and we'll turn that back on. And in just a moment, there we are, we're getting values so we remove the overlays. Now, it's important you understand that this overlay system doesn't just work with Tag Bindings, it's any binding. So, for example, if I were to go to this LED Display here, and if I were to replace the binding on the value property, so, instead of using a Tag Binding, I could instead use a Expression Binding. So if this expression came up with some sort of error, such as not having an expression at all, I can hit OK here, and again you'll see the overlay system kick in to effect. So, once again, if there's every any problems with any bindings, these overlays will let your users know right away.

                                    Perspective allows us to integrate network and internet driven resources seamlessly into our project. To this end, Perspective offers a special binding type called an HTTP Binding. This is an advanced binding type suitable for those familiar with web-development and HTTP. That said, the binding streamlines fetching of resources from network and internet locations. To demonstrate, I have a label here and on this label I'd like to show an HTML string that I derive from an internet source. So to demonstrate, I'm going to bind the text property of my Label, and I'm going to select an HTTP binding. From here, we can configure every aspect of our HTTP request So for starters, I can specify the target URL and actually, our URL is an expression so I can open up the Expression Editor here. I already have a static URL that I'd like to use so I'm just going to paste it in. And I'm going to click OK. Note that the quotation marks around the URL are required as this is a full-fledged expression. Now I can select the HTTP method I'd like to use. All HTTP methods are available, I'm just going to choose GET, I don't need to configure any headers for our request but if I did, I would click the plus icon here and if I click within the Key field, I can select a dropdown which will show all of the standard headers for our request I can also enter my own header and my Value again can be an expression. I don't need it right now so I'm just going to click the remove icon. I can also configure a body for our request again, an expression. And if the URL requires any authentication maybe it's an API, we can select an authentication type and enter the string for the authentication value that we need, I don't need any authentication right now. From here, we can also modify the timeouts for our requests. And finally, in addition to the standard binding options like Enabled and Overlay Opt-Out we have the option to allow or disallow Cookies from the URL and we can specify a Polling rate, I'll simply leave Polling off for now and that's all it takes, I can click OK now and text on the label has been populated with an HTML document from the URL. Now in this example, we're fetching HTML which we receive as a string. I'd like to use a different URL, one that will give us an object in JSON format. Since Perspective components also use JSON format, this will allow us to fetch JSON documents as Perspective component properties. So to demonstrate, on the root container of our View, I'd like to add a custom property. And I'd like it to be an Object, let's call this object "response" And now I'm going to configure another HTTP binding on the new custom property. Now I'll leave all of our settings the same as before I'll paste in the same URL, but this time I'm going to change it. So we're going to get a different page, this page that I'm using happens to be configured to return a JSON object. That's all it takes to configure, I'm going to leave everything else the same and I'm just going to click OK and now you can see that the response object in our custom properties has been populated with data from the URL.

                                    Project properties in Perspective are configured as JSON and are designed to allow for nested data structures. In light of this, Perspective offers a binding type for efficiently handling nested data, called the Expression Structure binding. The Expression Structure binding allows us to create a data structure using expressions to populate each entry in the structure. To demonstrate, I have a Carousel component here, and within the Carousel component I have a nested View called My Child View. Now this is working just fine, except our View is expecting two parameters, which I have not yet provided. Now if I'd like I could simply come to the viewParams property and enter them as values, but I'd like to try a slightly cleaner approach using an Expression Structure binding. So to do this I'll click the binding icon, and I'll select an Expression Structure binding. This binding will allow us to populate any Object property with nested Arrays, Objects, or Values. In this example I just need two Value parameters. So I'm going to select Add Object Member, and I'm going to select Value. The first parameter I'd like to specify is called iconPath. And I can assign to iconPath any expression. So I select the Expression Builder icon, and the expression I need will simply be material/insert_emoticon. All right, now I click OK. Now I need to add a second value to our structure. So I'm going to make a little bit more room, and I'm going to click the plus icon here, and I'm going to select another value. This one needs to be called labelText, and this value I'd like to fetch from a tag. So coming in here I'm going to remove the value, and I'm going to select the tag icon, I'm going to navigate to My Tag, and I'm going to click OK. And then I'm going to click OK to save. So now the label text that I'll be using in my child view will be populated from this tag. So in addition to our standard options, like enabled and overlay opt-out, we have a check box called Wait On All which will prevent the binding from populating the object until all nested values have been successfully fetched. Now if I'd like, I could add a transform, as long as I use a script transform here. And in here the value parameter will be a dictionary. So I could, for instance, reference the iconPath property... like this. Now I don't need a transform right now so I'm just going to click the trash can icon to remove it. And this completes the Expression Structure that I need for my viewParams property. So I'm going to click OK, and as we can see the view is populated with the parameters I configured.

                                    When working with complicated tag structures, it could prove useful to forego an Indirect Tag Binding and build an entire tag binding path from scratch. For this use case, we've provided a Tag Binding type called Expression. Not to be confused with an Expression Binding, this Tag Binding type allows us to use Ignition's expression language to dynamically specify an entire tag path. Here I have two tags I'd like to work with, one called Tag A, which is simply in the root directory of our tag provider. And I have another tag called Tag B, which is in this folder called Other Tags. I would like to configure a tag binding that will take in as a parameter either Tag A or Tag B, and appropriately direct to the correct tag. So to demonstrate, I've configured a couple buttons here. One is Open with Tag A. If I go to Events, I can see that it's opening our pop-up View that I'd like to use. It's passing in a parameter called tagToShow with a value of Tag A. I have another button, which is functionally the same except that it passes in a value of Tag B. So my pop-up view has this parameter configured called tagToShow. It has a label at the top that's simply showing the value that's passed in. And what I'd like to do is I'd like to take this text field component and bind its text to the tag that I'm passing in. So to do this, I'll configure a binding on the text property of the component. It will be a Tag Binding. And I'll use a binding type of Expression. Note that I could use an Indirect Tag Binding for this purpose, but it wouldn't get me very far, as the tag paths for our two tags are totally different. So the expression I'd like to use here is pretty simple. I'm just going to expand this so we have more room to work with. I already have the expression configured I'd like to use so I'm just going to paste it in. We can see it's a very simple expression. If the parameter that I pass in is equal to Tag A, bind it to the path Tag A. Otherwise, bind it to the path Other Tags/Tag B. Since I'm using a Text Field, I'd also like to make this bidirectional so the user can change the value on the tag. That's all it takes to configure. I'm going to click OK. And then to see this in action, I'm going to save our project. Then I'm going to launch a session. So I'm going to come to Tools, Launch Perspective, and Launch Session. And as we can see, when we open with Tag A, it shows Tag A and the text for Tag A. And when I open with Tag B, it shows Tag B and the text for Tag B. And if I'd like, I can change the text here to say whatever I'd like. And as we can see, it's been updated on our tag.

                                    When working with Tag History Bindings, it is sometimes useful to dynamically bind a tag path for your Tag History query. In Perspective, we can accomplish this using an expression inside our Tag History Binding. So, to demonstrate, I've configured a Main View here and on this Main View, I've configured an Embedded View component. This Embedded View component is using My History View and My History View takes a parameter called tagNum. Now, switching over to My History View here. And, as we can see, it contains a Table component. My goal for this table is that it will show historical data from either MyTag1 or MyTag2, depending on the parameter passed to the View. To configure this, we'll, of course, need a Tag History Binding. I've already configured the beginnings of a Tag History Binding here. For my table, I'm using a Return Format of Wide. I'm using a Query Mode of Periodic with a Period of 30 seconds, and a Time Range of 10 minutes. All that's left is to configure the tags I'd like to use and, in order to dynamically specify tags, I'll need to use Expression here. All that I plan on putting in my expression is a simple property reference. But, for that, I'll need a property. So, for now, I'll just come down here and click Cancel. And, on my table I've already started configuring the Property I'd like to use. The Tag History Binding is expecting an array of objects, and, for that, I configured a History Tags array and I've inserted an object into my array. Every object in this array corresponds to a tag that I'd like to retrieve historical data for. For the Tag History Binding to work, I need to provide three keys in each object. For starters, I need to specify a path to my tag. I can also specify an alias, which will give the tag a custom name in the returned data. And I can specify an aggregation mode to use for the tag history data. Since I already have the property configured, we can go up and take a look at how it'll work. So, I'll go back into my Tag History Binding. I'll specify Expression. And I'll find my property in the property browser. Now I just need to press OK to see how it works. And we can see that our query has been successful. Now, in order to make our tag path dynamic, we'll need to configure a binding on the path property. So, I'll select the binding icon for our path property. And I'll configure an Expression binding. I already have the expression I'd like to use. It's simply a tag path, where we pass in our View's tagNum parameter. So, I'll click OK. And then, just to see this in action, I'll clear out our alias so the tag name is shown above. And then I'll return to my Main View, select my Embedded View component, and then when I change the tagNum parameter, we can see that the tag changes from 1 to 2.

                                    Perspective offers a handful of tools to make building a project simpler and more efficient. One of the most prominent of these tools is the ability to drag tags from the tag browser into a view and automatically create a component to display the value of that tag. For example, I have an integer tag here with a value of 10 and when I drag it into my view, I can select a component I'd like to use to represent the tag in my view. If I choose a simple LED display, it shows the value of my tag. Note that what this is actually doing is creating a binding on the component to my tag. Now, I also have a string tag here and when I drag that into my view, a different menu appears. Every tag data type is associated with its own component menu. So for here, I'll just select label and I'll make it a little bit bigger. Now, if we'd like I can customize the components that are shown for each tag data type. To do that, we select a project and then project properties. And then within project properties we want to be at tag drop under perspective. The first part of this menu gives us the opportunity to configure different components for each tag data type.

**[01:10]** [01:10]
                                    So first, we select a data type, I'll stick with integer. So here we can see the components that can be created on an integer tag. To add a component, we click the plus icon and to remove a component from the list we click the trash can icon. So for example, let's say I want to add a component. I'll scroll down to the bottom of the list, and when I double click, I can see a dropdown that shows all of the components we could put in this menu. There are many components to choose from. Let's just say, I want a toggle switch, for example. And now when I drag in an integer tag, the toggle switch option will be available. This menu also gives us the ability to specify which bindings are actually configured on components that I create via tag drop. For example, if I specify a component type of cylindrical tank, by default the value property of the tag would be bound to the prop stock value property on the tank. I've also added another tag binding. Here I'm binding the metadata visible property on the cylindrical tank to the enabled property of the tag. So to see this inaction, I'm going to click OK and now I have an integer tag here that I've disabled.

**[02:15]** [02:15]
                                    So when I drag it into my view and select a cylindrical tank it is invisible because the visible property on the components has been bound to the enabled property on the tag. We'll also note that when I drag an integer tag in that toggle switch option is available because I've configured it as such in the list. That's it for our coverage of the tag drop interface. It's an easy way to configure what happens when you drag standard tag types into a view and want to create standard components from them. In other videos we'll explore how you can configure dropping in other types namely UDTs or even standard tags to create view instances rather than just components.

                                    In this lesson, we'll look at the map transform. A map transform allows you to take in an input value and then return one of several possible output values instead. So to start with I have this label and I have a memory tag. I would like to take the value on this memory tag, which is an integer, and then show some text here on the label depending on what the value is. We'll start with just a normal tag binding. On the text property, I'll click the binding icon. I want to use the value on my memory tag. So we'll use a normal direct tag binding to the memory tag. Now we see in the preview that this returns the value of the tag. I want to replace this with text. An easy way to do that would be to add a map transform. So I can hit the add transform button here and we'll see a little popup window up here. We'll stick with the map transform for now and talk about the others in later videos. So a map transform allows you to take some inputs or a range of inputs and turn them into an output. I'll hit the add transform button and whenever you're using a map transform, we always start or at least give you a fallback value. So if our input happens to be something you didn't define, we'll use the fallback. I'll add a couple of rows to this table by pressing the plus button over here a couple of times. So the way this works is whatever value's on the tag, we're going to go ahead and push down to this transform as an input. And then we'll try to find a matching output. So for the input type column, I can define some values. We'll type zero and one respectively. And then I can come over to the output type column and then specify what I want to return from the transform based on what the bindings bringing in. So if the tag bindings returning was zero, we can return the string off and if it returns a one, we can return the string on. Let's also define a fallback value. So if our tag binding returns anything other than a zero or one, the transform will return the string error. If I hit okay, we can see the value in my tag as one. So it's showing on, if I change the value of my tag and can see that it's off, when I said it to zero, if I change it to something else, you can see that it gives us an error. So we're taking the numerical value on the tag here and we're turning it into a string. Now if I go back into the interface here and take a look at our transform, notice that I can add more transforms. So if I were to add another map, you can see that it adds another map down below as well as showing it on this little path down here. So it shows us what the value is ultimately going to end with as well as everything along the way. So the takeaway from this is that one transform can lead into another transform. Be careful with chaining too many of these. In some cases it might be easier to try a different binding all together or maybe take a different approach instead of making four or five transforms. Now let's close this window and look at my led display. The value on this component is currently bound to my memory tag. I'll select this component and I would like to change the value of the diode on color property based on the value of the tag. Just like last time, we'll start by creating a binding. I'll click the icon, we'll select a tag binding and for the tag path, I'll grab my memory tag once again. We hit okay and when we add the transform this time while I'm selecting map again, we can actually change the input and the output. So there's actually some dropdowns over here. So instead of just looking at each individual value, I can click up here and select a numeric range of values. And with the output type we can actually do something very similar. I'll click where it says value and you'll see that there's a dropdown. I'm going to use color, but you can see that there's a bunch of options. We'll talk about them in later videos. So I'll pick color for right now. And then how about for the fall back color here, we'll just specify maybe a blue color. I'll add a couple of rows here. And how about when we were in range? Maybe we could just stick with our green color and then when we're a little too high maybe how about we jump to a red color? Then we need to define the ranges. So if I double click in this cell over here, we can see that it actually shows me an example of what it wants for the format. So square brackets, a minimum and a maximum value. So if I start typing, I can place one to 10 in here. So if the value on the tag is between one and 10 and that's inclusive, so it's including those numbers, then we'll return the green color. So I'll hit enter to commit here. And then how about for the red? We can state 11 as the minimum value and then choose to not include a maximum in this case. So if I close this off here, we're saying that the value, if it's 11 or higher, use red. I'll hit apply right now and if we move this out of the way, you can see that I'm well above 10 so we're showing the red color. If I were to type in five, we can see that we fall back within range and if I go to a negative number, which we really didn't define, you can see that we're using the blue color. Now one last thing, I'll bring the binding window back. You can also omit a minimum instead. So maybe up above here, instead of setting it to one as the minimum, I can remove the one, hit enter and now I'm basically saying if it's 10 or lower we're green. If it's 11 or higher, we're red. If we somehow get something else, we'll use the blue color. Hit okay again, and you can see we were blue before, but now with negative 50, we're showing green. So hopefully that gives you a good idea about what these map transforms can do. Again, they're fantastic when you're taking the value of a tag or a property and you need to convert that value into a different data type.

                                    In this lesson we'll take a look at the Format Transform. The Format Transform allows you to take a numerical value or a date value, and change the formatting of it for the binding. So, in my View I have two Labels. One of which has a number on it, and that's because it's bound to this Memory Tag here. It's currently set to a float. Let's examine this binding. So, with that component selected, I'll head over to the text property, and click the binding icon. We'll press the Add Transform button. And I'll select Format. Click Add Transform once more. And we can see the Format Transform. So again, there's really two types. Right now we're using the numeric type. Later on I'll switch over and show you the datetime. Now, for both types of transforms, they do have a locale selector, which tries to automatically detect which locale you're in. So, the part of the world I'm in right now uses a period as a decimal separator. But if I were to change the locale selector to another part of the world that uses say, a comma, such as Bulgaria. If I hit apply, here, you can see it down below in the preview, but you can definitely see it a little bit easier on the binding. So, we're not changing what's on the source of the binding in this case here. Instead, we're taking that value, we're applying some formatting, and then returning that updated value to the property on the component. Now, I'll switch the locale back to auto. And with the format drop down, this has a bunch of options on how to format. So for example, I could switch it to integer, where it just drops the decimal value, here. I could switch it to a currency, where it adds a character in front to denote that this is a currency based on the region of the world I'm in. I could come up here and select percent, which shows it as a percentage. Or I could select pattern. Pattern allows me to explicitly define what the format should be. Now, in this label, maybe this is showing off a total. So I could actually just type the word total, and have that be effectively a prefix. To represent your number, you use the pound or the hash character. So I could put some down here for my decimal separator, and a couple more and you can see down below it's showing the decimal value now. You may have seen this notation elsewhere in Ignition. That character really means just show significant values at that position. So for example, with the decimal values here, if I wanted to always show two decimal positions, even if the second one or either of them are zero, I could replace that character with some zeroes. And you can see down below we're actually forcing that decimal position. So if you needed to apply some formatting or add a prefix or a suffix to a binding, you could potentially use this transform. That's enough for the numeric type. Let's take a look at the datetime. So I'm going to hit OK, here. And on my next label. Let's take a look at the binding on the text property here. And I'll use an expression this time. We'll use the nowexpression function to get the current time. And then we'll set it to a one-minute poll. Let's add another transform here. We'll select Format, yet again. And then we'll go ahead and switch over to the datetime type. So again we have the locale as well as the time zone if you needed to override the time zone. The format drop down allows you to specify a date, a time, a datetime, or a pattern you type yourself. To demonstrate, if I select date, we no longer show the time, and I get this easy little drop down I can use to define how expansive we should be with the date. So if I select full, you can see that it actually includes the day of the week, as well as spelling out the month. If I switch this to short, it gives us a more compact version of the date. I'll head back to format. If I switch to time, you can see it does something similar, except now we're looking at the time instead of the date. I can still use this drop down. It's now the time drop down. And either select full, short or something in between. Now if I come back up to format, and I pick datetime, it gives me both. So I can kind of combine them however I want. Now if you wanted a little more control, here though, you could with the format drop down select pattern, and then you type in what exactly it is you want to see. Again, this uses another kind of formatting pattern you'd see elsewhere in Ignition, where certain letters denote different units of time. So for example, capital M would be the month. And more sequential characters spell out that unit of time a bit more. So if I add a third M here, it'll actually give me the first three letters of the month. If I add a fourth one, it'll spell out the month for me. If you're interested in learning about the other characters, take a look at the user manual for more information. But hopefully that gives you a good idea about what the Format Transform does. Again, it's a very easy way to apply different formatting to numbers and dates.

                                    In this lesson, we'll take a look at the Script Transform. So here, I have a Label. This Label has its text property bound to this temperature Memory Tag. I'd like to apply a Script Transform just to talk about what it can do. Let's click on the binding icon here. And we see I'm using a Tag binding, I'll add a transform, and we've selected the Script Transform. Now the Script Transform will go and run a Python script, meaning you can do quite a bit. Now, in most cases, the Script Transform probably shouldn't be your go-to transform. The other transforms can do quite a bit, and have very simple interfaces. Technically, the Script Transform can do the same thing that those other transforms can do, but you have to write the code. Regardless, let's take a look. So, I'll add one. And you can see we get a little interface to start typing some Python code. Now, the Script Transform is ultimately part of a function definition here, so you want to keep this gutter clear, or have everything indented over. Additionally, you generally want to return something here. The whole point of using a Script Transform is to take the value from the binding or the prior transform, do something with it, and then return something. So, I'm going to make a little bit of room here. And how about just a real simplistic example, move this down a bit, and maybe we can just test to see if our value's past a certain point. You can see that we do have a built-in value object that's defined up above, as well as quality and timestamp. And, of course, the self argument which gives us a reference to the component this transform is on. So, how about in this case, we'll check to see if the value is greater than 100, if it is, we'll return the string "Too hot", otherwise just return whatever the value is. So, we'll hit OK. And you can see, we're showing the same value that's on my tag on the component. I try to change the value here. You can see it's suddenly "Too hot". Now if we head back to the interface there, to kind of wrap up this little lesson here, this transform's almost like a property change script, if you think about it. As long as this view's open, whenever the binding updates, we'll call our script. So, we can do a whole bunch of stuff from here.

                                    In this lesson, we'll take a look at the Expression Transform. In my View here, I have a Label and the text property of my Label is currently bound to this little temperature Memory Tag. I would like to add some static text into this Label in addition to the tag's value. Let's take a look at the binding here on the text property. And we can see we're just doing a direct tag binding right now. I'm going to add a transform. We'll select an expression type, and I'll click Add Transform. Also make this a little bit bigger and zoom in with control and the mouse wheel here. So when you're using the Expression Transform, there's this built in reference value. This represents whatever value that's being passed in from either the binding or any prior transforms. If you need to use the reference in multiple locations in your expression, you can simply type it again. Right now I'm simply doubling the value, just to kind of show you I can add it again. Now I don't want to double here, instead I want to add some static text. So why don't I head over to the left hand side here, and lets add some static text. How about we just say current temperature and then state the value. Now I do appear to have a little spacing problem, we'll add a trailing space here, so it looks a little bit nicer. And maybe we can close this off with a unit of some sort, so maybe this is the temperature in celsius. We'll hit okay here and when we check our Label you can see that it now has the static text, as well as the tags value. And of course because it's a binding. If I change the value that's on the tag, it's now incredibly hot, but the text is still there. Now let's head back to the binding and what I'm showing you here, is admittedly a bit contrived. We could have just as easily used an Expression Binding to accomplish the same thing. So the reason you would want to use the Expression Transform, there's actually a couple. So for one, I've separated the actual expression I'm writing here, from the value that's coming in. These are two separate entities that can change independently of each other. So I could change the tag path later on from here. I could make this an indirect binding instead. But my expression is still going to work the same. I'll switch back to a direct Tag Binding for a moment. Lastly the other reason you'd want to consider an Expression Transform is that remember you can chain transforms together, so if I were to add another transform, say we'll do a Format Transform this time. I'll add that in here. We can always just use an Expression Transform after any others. So if I were to swap position of these two here, you can see that we're still kind of chained together and I'm ultimately ending with my Expression Transform. So if I were to change the format on this, say this is a currency all of a sudden. Our first transform is working, applying whatever work it needs to, to the value, and then hands that off to the expression. So we can always just end our bindings with an Expression Transform, to do any sort of clean up or additional data manipulation.

                                    In this lesson, we'll talk about styles in Perspective. Styles are the main way in the Perspective module to change the look and formatting of your components. To begin with, I'll go into my Perspective component palette and I'll go ahead and drag a label component into my view here. And I'll go ahead and resize that component a bit. Now you may have noticed when working with components in Perspective, that pretty much every component has a style property here under the props section in the property editor. You may also notice that apart from this section particularly on components like the label component here look and feel properties are pretty sparse, that is to say, unlike in the Vision module, you aren't finding too many text color or font size properties exposed directly in the property editor. Most of those settings are handled by this style property here. This property allows you to configure what's called an inline style, which basically means you're applying formatting and style settings directly on the component.

**[01:05]** [01:05]
                                    We can contrast this with style classes, which we'll talk about in later videos, basically they're a way of configuring styles as project resources rather than on specific components. But here, to configure an inline style, I'll go ahead and find that style property on my label and I'll click the little paint swatch icon on the right-hand side, and that will open up our style menu. Now I won't go through all the options here, there's quite a bit we can do from this menu, but maybe I'll expand the text header here and I could change the font, so maybe I could make it Helvetica, I could type in a font size, so maybe 30 point font, I could change the color of the text, so maybe I'll go into the palette here and make it a green, and I could find the weight property and make my text bold. So all of the properties under this text heading here give us ways of configuring how the text on our component should look. It's worth noting that these properties are available on more than just labels. Styles can be thought of as a unified way of modifying the look and feel of components meaning that every component that you go into the style menu for will have these same properties available.

**[02:12]** [02:12]
                                    So maybe one final property I'll set here is the text align property. I'll set that to center which will center the text inside of my label, and then I'll go ahead and collapse that text heading. Now you may have noticed that all of the options I have selected are available in the left-hand side here in this panel. And if I wanted to clear any out let's say I don't like the color any more, I can click the x on the right-hand side to remove that property and set it back to the default. So there are quite a few other properties in here and like I said, I won't get into all of them, but background, for example, would allow me to change the background color of my label or set an image up. Margin and padding would allow me to introduce an offset into one or more of the edges of my component so if I wanted to shift my content five pixels down or to the left, I could do something like that. Border will allow me to configure some nice edge stylings for my component.

**[03:08]** [03:08]
                                    Shape properties come into play when we're working with graphics like SVGs. And then there are some miscellaneous properties at the bottom, like making my component partially transparent or changing the cursor when you hover over it, that kind of stuff. If you have a web development background you may have noticed when looking at these properties here that we've effectively taken many properties of CSS and added them directly into the Perspective module. As such, the style menu effectively allows you to configure CSS features on your component. So, once I'm done picking out properties, I can go ahead and click OK on the bottom, and now you'll find that those properties we've changed are exposed in the property editor here. So, if you wanted to make the properties dynamic, the best approach is to configure an inline style on that property and then you can buy into it using the icons here. So, that's should be enough to get you started with styles. As you can see, they're very easy to configure and get set up.

                                    In this lesson, we'll talk about style classes. Style classes are similar to the inline styles that we've seen in other videos but style classes live in their own resource up in the project browser. Style classes allow you to configure a style and then apply it to many different components. Very similar to how a template works, just like a template, any changes you make to the style class will then propagate down to all of the components that's using it. To get started, we'll make a style class by right clicking on the styles folder here and selecting new style. We can then give our style class a name. I'm going to use the name background because I'm simply going to change the background color for my style. We are then presented with a popup that contains all the same styling options that we've seen before. I wanted to change the background color of my style so I'm simply going to go to background and choose a new color, maybe some light blue or something like that and then hit OK down below. We've now created our style, you can see it here called background but we're not actually using it at this point. Let's grab a component so that we can use our new style class. I'm just going to grab a simple label component here and add it to my screen then with the label selected, we're going to take a look at the property editor. Instead of clicking on the modify style button like we do with inline styles, I'm actually going to go to the classes property and select the browse styles button. We are given a list of all of the style classes that we have in this project. You can see I have the background style there so I can go ahead and select that one and it's going to apply that style class to my label. Just like with templates, if I wanted to make a change to the style class, I simply need to go back to the style class background in the project browser, double click on it to open it up and make some more changes. Maybe this time I will add a border and I'll give the border a specific width and color. Once I hit Ok, that new addition to my style will be added to the style class and since the style class is being used on this label, the label will automatically get that new edition. Now what's great about these style classes is that you don't have to put all stylistic elements in a single style class. You can actually mix and match the style classes on a single component. I'm going to go add another style class and this one I am going to configure the text. So I'll call it text and create that. I'm going to go into the text section and maybe choose a new font, maybe a mono-space font and a specific size, let's say 20 point font. We'll hit OK and now that we have that new style, I can select my label and go apply that style class to this label as well. You'll notice the list of classes here is simply a list of check boxes and I can select that text style class and you can see that my labels text has now changed. So as you can see, these style classes are a great way to categorize this style of your elements across the entire project in one convenient location. Lastly, I want to mention that you can still apply an inline style to a component that is using a style class. Your style class may be very general as they're used for many components throughout the project but maybe on a particular component, you want to apply some extra styling without having to do it to the style class and add it to every component. You can simply apply the inline style just like you normally would. Selecting new component and going and selecting the modify styles button. Here we can add a style attribute maybe I will set the text alignment to be in the center and you can see now that my text is centered in the label. So again, style classes act as sort of style templates that we can add to many components throughout our project.

                                    In this lesson, we'll talk about the animated style classes. An animated style class transitions across multiple style configurations over some period of time. You can see here that I have a label with a style class called 'alarm' already attached to it. I want this style class to act as a flashing alarm indicator so let's go ahead and double click on it to open it up. You'll notice when configuring the style class that in the upper right-hand corner, there's the option to make this style animated. When we enable this, the interface will change just a bit with more options to make the style animated. Now we won't be going over all these properties here. They're all defined in our user manual, but we'll go over some of the important ones. The way the animated style class works is it transitions between two or more different styles. You'll notice first off there is a duration property. The animation is going to occur across the duration period which in this case is set to two seconds. The different stye configurations are then set up on this line down here that goes from zero to 100%. For example, we currently have 0% selected so if I go into my style configuration and set something like a background color, maybe one of these light reds here. Now if I were to apply this and move this edit style window out of the way, you'll notice that my label is transitioning from a red to a white. The white color here comes from the other style which is set up on 100%. Now because I didn't set anything there, it's just going to use the sort of base style where the background color is white, but if I wanted to change that to a different color, I would simply need to select 100%. You'll notice the style configuration sort of resets here. I no longer have that red background color and I can come in and apply maybe a different background color, say maybe a yellow color. I'll go ahead and hit 'apply' to apply that change and if we look at our label now, we can see that it bounces between that red color at 0% and that yellow color at 100% over the duration of two seconds. Finally, if I wanted to add more style configurations to my animation, more stops that the animation has to make along this line, then we simply need to right-click on the line and you'll notice we have the option to add a stop. Just like before, this new stop will have reset all of the style configurations and we can set them as we see fit and I can also move this stop around anywhere along this line to determine when that transition happens.

                                    In this lesson, we are going to talk about dynamically changing the style class applied to a component. I have a label here, and this label has no stylistic properties applied to it. And I have a style class called Alarm. I only want this Alarm style class to be applied to my component when this tag AlarmBit is set to true, indicating that there is some sort of an alarm going on. Now, there are many different ways that we can approach this. But what we're going to do in this video, is use a binding and a transform to determine what style class is applied based on that AlarmBit. So we're going to go to My Label, make sure it's selected, and set up a binding on the style classes property. Now we want this binding to be based on the value of the tags, so I'm going to choose a Tag Binding type, and set the binding to be looking at my AlarmBit tag. Now, while this Tag Binding by itself is a valid binding, it's not going to give us the value that we're looking for. The style class property is expecting the name of one of my style classes as a string. And right now we're going to be returning either true or false based on the value of the tag. So we can use a transform to change the value that is being returned from the tag into the value that we're looking for. In this case, we're going to use a Map Transformation going from one input of either true or false to an output of the name of our style class. We have two possible inputs, either a true or a false value. So I'm going to go ahead and add two new rows to my mapping table here. I'll go ahead and type in our two input values. First, the value of false and hit enter to apply it. And then the value of true. Again, hitting enter to apply it. Now again, the output value simply need to be the name of a style class. So for the true input, I want to apply the Alarm style class. So I'm going to type in the name of that style class exactly as it appears, including that capital A and then hit enter. You'll notice that quotation marks automatically appeared around the style class name. This is because it does need to be a string. Now for the false value, I don't want to apply a style class, but rather than leaving this blank, which will return a no, I simply want to return an empty string. To do that, we can do something similar to what we did for the true output value, simply double clicking in here, but rather than typing in a style class name, I'm simply going to hit enter, and not type anything in. This will put an empty string into the property rather than a null. It's also always a good idea to set a fallback value, and my fallback is also going to be no style class applied. So I'm going to do the same thing that we did for the false output, just an empty string. Now that we have that set up, we can go ahead and hit Okay. And you can see that we now have a binding on the classes property. Remember it is based on the value of the tag, so I'm going to go ahead and set my tag value to true. And you can see that my Alarm style class gets applied to this component. Now I do have a second style class, this one called Border. And let's say I want to apply both of these when the AlarmBit is true, rather than just the Alarm style class. Let's take a look at how we would handle that in our mapping transform. When applying multiple style classes to a component, we simply need to list all of them out and separate them with a space. So for my true input, I'm going to go to the output value and simply add in the name of my Border style class right next to the Alarm style class, separated by a space. You'll notice it's still within the quotation marks. And I do need to remember to hit enter to apply that. Once I have that I can hit Okay, and you can see that now both the Alarm style class and the Border style class are applied.

                                    In this lesson, we'll talk about Element States on style classes. So I have two Labels here. Both of them are using this style class called HoverLabel. I would like to be able to change the background color on these Labels when I hover over them. This would be a good use of an Element State. Element States live on style classes, so let's head over to our Project Browser and under the Perspective Module, under the Styles folder, we have our HoverLabel, which I'll double click on. So we have our base rules here that are making some changes to my components. But if I press the Add button, we can add an Element State. So an Element State is an additional styling configuration you can make on a style class, that takes effect when the component is in a certain state. So for example, from the little drop-down here, if I scroll down, I can select hover. So when I'm hovering my mouse cursor in front of the component, we can apply these styling changes. So how about for the background? Let's change it to a different color. So I'll click my drop-down. I'll go for this first little blue here, and we'll press okay. Let's try this in a session, so we'll go ahead and we'll save our project. I'll go to Tools, Launch Perspective, and I'll launch a session. Now you can test this out in the Designer, but of course, it's always a good idea to try things out in your session, and you can see that it's working. So when I move my mouse cursor in front of a Label, it's changing the background color. That about wraps up our video on Element States. Again, they're a fantastic way to change the style configuration on a component based on the state of the component.

                                    In this lesson, we'll talk about Media Queries in style classes. A Media Query is an opportunity to change what a style class does based on the device that's launching, or hosting, the session. The reason you'd care about media queries is that they allow you to make changes to your styles based on things such as the width of the session. So I have a Label here which doesn't have a style class right now. Let's create a new one. So, from the Project Browser here, under Perspective, and Styles, I'll right click on the Styles folder and select New Style. We'll give this a name, I'll just call it MediaQuery for now, and create a style class. Now I'm not going to make any changes to the base style. Instead I'll hit the Add icon here, and select Media Query. And we can define some rules for the Media Query in the style class. So, for example, I'll change the Media Query to max width. And maybe change the pixel size to 500. I'll head over to text, and maybe increase the font size. So, if with hit OK here, I select my Label, and for the classes property here on my Label, let's use the new style class. So, I'll hit the dropdown, I select my Media Query here, and we'll save our project. Now for the media query rules, you may or may not see them in the Designer based on certain criteria. So, in this case, it might be easier for us to launch a session, and look at this View. So, it looks pretty much the same as my Designer in terms of font size here. But notice that when I reduce the width, it gets larger. So if I'm designing for both desktop and mobile, and I'm using the same views, I can use these Media Query rules to help improve readability on some of my screens.

                                    In this lesson, we'll talk about Perspective themes. Other videos here on inductive university have talked about inline styles and style classes for perspective components. Those allow you to make visual changes to individual components. A theme is a visual style that's applied to all components, with the idea being that inline styles and style of classes can override what the theme is doing. When you create a new project, you start with the light theme. But you can very easily switch to a different theme. Over here I have a couple of buttons. When I click on the dark button, I would like to switch over to the dark theme, doing that as incredibly easy, we actually have a component action for it. So if I right click on the dark button, I can go down to configure events and under Component Events, I'll select the onActionPerformed event and I'll add a theme action. And we can see that we have a dropdown that lists all of the available themes. Now we ship ignition with some things by default, but you may have more or less here depending on version of ignition, as well as whether or not you have custom themes. For more information, check out our perspective theming content in the user manual. For right now, I'll just leave this selected as dark we'll press okay and I'll test this out in the designer, enter preview mode, I'll press the button and we switched over to the dark theme. I already configured my light button here to switch back to the light theme. So I'll just press that right now. And you can see we're back to the light theme. Now, in addition to the component action, we actually have a session prop that allows you to change the active theme. So if I head down to the little gear icon here and we take a look at our session prompts, they'll notice that there is in fact a theme property. So I could come over here and instead of giving my users a way to change the theme in the project, I could just set this to dark save my project and new sessions will launch using the dark theme. I can also come back to the view I was working on and you'll notice that it's back to the dark theme. Now, in addition to the actions and just statically setting the theme on the session prop. We can get a little more flexible with switching themes. So if I go back to design mode here, I have this dropdown and inside of the dropdown, I configured a couple of options one for light, one for dark. So I could just bind the value property here to that session prop. So I'll click the little binding icon. We'll do a property binding. I'll go ahead and I'll browse for that session prop and under the session object under props, we do have the theme property I'll click okay and in my case, I do want this drop down to write back to the session prop. So I'll make sure to set bi-directional I'll click OK And once again, we can test this out. So back into preview mode, click on the dropdown, click on light, and we're back to the light theme. And there you have it, a couple of different ways to switch between themes in your perspective sessions.

                                    Say you're building a Perspective project, and you want to navigate between pages or views at the press of a button. Or maybe you want to press a key to show a pop-up view. In Perspective, clicking a button or pressing a key are examples of what we call events. We can choose how we want to respond to these events, and the ways in which we respond are called actions. Let's discuss how to configure events and actions so our project can effectively handle different user inputs.

**[00:36]** [00:36]
                                    So let's say we do one of the things I mentioned, we're going to configure simple navigation on a button. For that we'll need a button, we'll come over here to our Component Panel, click on button, and drag it in. I'm going to make it a little bit bigger just so we can see it better, then I'm going to center it right there. So, in order to configure an event on our button, we're going to click on it, right click, then come down and click Configure Events. This will bring up the Event Configuration dialog for our button. This is a list of all of the events we can use on our button. As you can see, there are many events, you can check out our user manual for more details on every Perspective event.

**[01:16]** [01:16]
                                    I'm just going to highlight a couple common ones here. An onClick event will run whenever we press a button on our mouse. Scrolling down, we have keyboard events, which will run whenever we press a key on our keyboard. I'm just going to configure a simple onClick event, which will run whenever our button is pressed. So, when I select an event, I now have the option to configure one or more actions for this event. In order to add an action, I'm going to come over here and click the plus icon. As you can see, there are many actions to choose from as well. I could log in or log out of the session, I could navigate to a new page or view of the session, I could configure a pop-up view, I could refresh the browser, or if nothing does quite what we need, I could run a script.

**[02:02]** [02:02]
                                    I'm just going to configure a simple navigation action for our button. Now, I'm going to add another action as well, just for a moment. I'm going to add a log out action. These actions will be run in the order that they're listed here from top to bottom. To change their order I can use the up arrow to move log out up, and the down arrow to move log out down. I don't actually want Logout for now, so I'm going to just delete it using the trash can icon.

**[02:36]** [02:36]
                                    So, selecting our Navigation action, we can see that we have different types of navigation we can do. Page navigation will take us to a new page of our project, View navigation will swap out the main view on the current page, and "url" will take us to an external url. I already have a page configured, so I'm just going to use page navigation to get us there. Page 2. So I could disable this action if I don't need it right now. I could also choose to open our new page in a new tab. I'm alright opening it in our current tab. So, that's all it takes to configure our event and our action. Now I'm just going to click OK.

**[03:19]** [03:19]
                                    And, I want to see this in action, so I'm going to go to save, and then I'm going to run our session. So, we go to Tools, Launch Perspective, and Launch Session. From here you can see the page and the view we were working on. So, when I click my button it opens a new page of our project.

                                    In Perspective, the Navigation Action allows a user to open a new Page, swap out a main View, or navigate to another URL. As such, the Navigation Action is a critical tool in building your Perspective project, since almost every project will require some form of navigation. In this lesson we'll walk through configuring each type of Navigation Action, and we'll observe how they behave. Here I have a simple View. This is where I'll be configuring my Navigation Actions. I've set up a few Views and Pages we'll be navigating to. So clicking on the gear icon here, I can see that I have two Pages configured. One is our root Page, and I've associated Main View 1 which is the View we were just on. I also have a second Page called Page 2, which I have associated with Main View 2. Here's Main View 2. I've also configured another View called Main View 3 which I have not associated with a Page. However, I have provided the ability to pass in a parameter, called myParam, which will populate this label. Let's walk though configuring our Navigation Actions for this project's structure. So I'll return to Main View 1, and here I've set up three buttons. One for each type of navigation we'll configure. So let's start by implementing our button to take us to Page 2. So I'll click on the button, right-click, and select Configure Events. I'll use an onClick event so that when someone clicks on the button it will navigate. I'll click on the plus icon here to add a Navigation Action. And here we can see the three different types of navigation that are possible. Here we're going to navigate to a different Page of our project. So I'll select my Page that I've configured called Page 2. I also have the option of opening the Page in a new tab, but I want to open it in our current tab, so I'll select OK. And now to test out our new button, I'll come up and I'll click Save. I'll come to Tools, Launch Perspective, and Launch Session. Now when I click my To Page 2 button it takes us to a new Page of our project. And you can tell it's a new Page because the Page URL has changed. There is now this Page2 string in the URL. I've already configured a Navigation Action to return us to Page 1. And now I'll just minimize the session so we can work on more buttons. Next, I want to configure a button to take us to Main View 3, which we have not associated with a Page. So I'll click on To Main View 3, right click, go to Configure Events again, and I'll configure another onClick event with a Navigation Action. So the navigation type this time will be View. And we can select the View that we would like to use. In my case it will be Main View 3. And now remember, Main View 3 is expecting a parameter that it will display. This dialogue will provide us the opportunity to add this parameter. So I'll click the plus icon here and it already knows about the parameter I'm using called myParam. Now if I wanted to, I could pass in some property from the current View, but I'm just going to configure a basic string. That's all that it takes. I'm gonna come down and click OK now. I'm going to save the project again. I'm going to pull the session back up, and I'm going to click To Main View 3 here, and I'm at my new View. As we can see, the parameter has been passed through successfully. Also note that we're not doing Page navigation here. The URL has not changed. We've simply swapped out the main View for our current Page. So I'll return to Main View 1. And now we'll work on configuring the third button to take us to an external URL. So I'm going to minimize the session again. We're going to click on our third button, right click. Configure Events, onClick, click the plus icon, click navigation, and this time we're going to use a type of URL. Now I could enter any valid URL here. For instance, I could use URL navigation to take us to a different Perspective project on the same gateway. I'm just going to take us to inductiveautomation.com. This time, I'd like to open the URL in a new tab so that our session stays open. I'll click OK. I'll hit Save again. And I'll pull our session back up, and I'll click our third button. As we can see it opens inductiveautomation.com in a new tab.

                                    The most comprehensive action in Perspective is the Script Action which allows us to harness the full power of Ignition's scripting platform. As such, Script Actions provide additional flexibility when other Perspective actions don't quite accomplish what we need. In this lesson, we're going to walk through configuring a very basic Script Action. You can find more information about specific uses for Script Actions in our user manual. I've created a simple view to help us out here. On this view I have an Icon component, and I have a Label component that I've called Counter. My goal is just that when I click on my Icon it will increment the value on my Label. So to configure this, I'll need a Script Action. So I'll select my Icon Component, right click, and click Configure Events. I'm going to select an onClick event, and I'm going to click the plus icon to add an Action, and I'll need a Script Action. So every Script Action is provided two objects as parameters. Self is a reference to the component, the event is on, and can be used to reference other components or properties in your Script. Event is a reference to an underlying object associated with the event. The event object has many useful properties. You can find more in the User Manual about the event objects associated with each event type. We're going to use the self object to build a path to the text property on our Label so we can increment it. I already have the script that we'll need so I'm just going to paste it in. It's pretty simple. Just self.getSibling to get another component in the same container as our current component, and then I have to specify its name. I've called it "Counter". And then the path to the property that I want is simply .props.text. And then += 1 just adds 1 to its current value. So to see this in action I'm going to click OK, and I'm going to enter Preview Mode, and then I just click on my Icon, and it increments the value on my counter. So now I'd like to add one more piece of functionality to our script. I'm going to turn off Preview Mode. I'm going to right-click our Icon Component again. I'm going to go back into our Events dialog, and now I want to make it so that if the users holds the Shift key while they click on the icon, it increments by five rather than one. Configuring this might sound complicated, but it's actually pretty easy in Perspective. I just need to add a little bit of extra logic to our existing script. So I'll start by adding a line at the beginning that simply says if event.shiftKey == True: and then I'll paste the previous line again, and this time I want to increment by five rather than one, so I'll replace the one with a five. And then I'll say else, so if the Shift key was not pressed, we will just increment by one. So that's all it takes. I'm just going to come down and press OK now, and I go back into Preview Mode. I'm just going to click normally once or twice. Now I'm going to hold down the Shift key while I click, and as we can see, it increments by five instead of one.

                                    In this lesson, we'll talk about the Dock Action. So, in my Designer here, I have a couple of views ready to go. I have one titled West Dock and I would like to have another component show or hide this dock based off of user interaction. So, we'll use this view called the Dock Action here, and then from this view, I want to show or hide the West Dock. There is an action for that, the Dock Action. So, we'll get started by adding a component. We'll head over to the Perspective Component Palette, and under the Input category, I'll grab a button just because it's really easy to use and trigger. Now, before I dive in and start configuring the action, there's one thing you'll want to take care of real quick. When you're using the Dock Action, you'll need to specify a dock ID. So, what I mean by that is if we head over to the cog icon or the home of the Perspective section, we can see that I have my West Dock view already configured as a dock under the shared settings. If we edit this dock, there is a dock ID. So, if you're trying to conditionally show or hide the dock and you're not using a handle, you'll need a value here just to be able to single out and call that one dock. So, you can type whatever you'd like in here. I'll just call this west. Now, you may want to play around with some of the other settings, too. You may want to change the content to cover, especially if you're designing for a smaller device, so that way we're not warping and pushing all of your other components on your primary view out of the way. Also, again, if you're designing for a smaller screen here, you may not want the dock to be immediately visible, so you could set this to On Demand. But the important part here is the dock ID, so we'll hit OK, and let's configure the action. So, we'll go to our Dock Action view or whatever view you're configuring this on. We'll select our button, we'll right click, go down to Configure Events, and under Mouse Events, I'll select onClick since I'm using a button here. We'll hit the plus icon and we'll select the Dock Action. With the Dock Action, there aren't too many settings you have to configure. So, here you can specify if you wanted to open, close, or toggle the state of the dock. So, if it's closed, open it. If it's open, close it. In this case, we'll toggle it. And we need that dock ID under the identifier area, so if you recall, I called mine west. Now, I am statically typing in an identifier here, but we do see there's a little icon to the right, which allows us to browse the various properties within our session or within this one view. So, basically, this gives you a way to dynamically change the identifier in some way. We'll leave that alone for right now. We'll stick with the static identifier, and I'll just click okay. And we'll save our project. And let's get a session open, so I'll go back to the home of the Perspective Module here. And for my Dock Action, I'll go ahead and right-click. We'll launch the URL. So, if I press my button, we see the dock appear. If I press it again, it goes away. So, now we're toggling the dock with this one action. So that should give you a good idea of how to get to started with a docked action. Again, the identifiers are really the important part here. You want to make sure you're giving unique dock IDs to all of your docks in your project.

                                    In this lesson, we'll talk about the Login and Logout actions. I have a session in front of me. It has a couple of buttons, one of which has a Script action that has some security restrictions. So, if I press this button, we can see that the action was denied. I've designed it so that when you press the button, you must be authenticated, or at least logged in to the session. So, if you've designed your project in such a way that a user can have unauthenticated access, you may want to occasionally give them the chance to login, which is what the Login action is for. Now, these other buttons don't do anything right now. We'll have to configure something. So let's go ahead and close our session here. We can see that I have the view right in front of me. For my Login button, I'll simply right click, and configure events. I'll select the onClick event, and then from the action list over here, we can hit the Add icon. And we see that there is a Login action. Now when I select this action, you'll see that there's not a lot in the ways of configuration here. This action will simply prompt the user to login. Now there is one project setting you'll need to be aware of. I'll hit OK for right now. And that project setting is under Project Properties. Towards your Project Browser here, we do have our little Project Properties button you can click on. And under Perspective and General, you want to make sure you have an Identify Provider configured. In this case, I don't, which means my action would've failed, so we'll click the dropdown, I'll select my default Provider, but of course, you'd select whatever Identity Provider your organization wants you to use. We'll hit OK here. And before I head back to my session, let's talk about the Logout action real quick. I'll select the button, I'll right click on it, we'll go to the same area, we'll go to Configure Events, and again, on the onClick event, we'll hit the Add button and select the Logout action. Again, not a whole lot to configure. But let's hit OK. We've made a bunch of changes, let's save our project, and let's get that session back, so I'll just go to Tools, Launch Perspective, and I'll launch a Session. So we're back, nothing's really changed. I can't press the button because I haven't logged in yet. So if I close that little message, and I press my Login button, my session gets redirected to my Identity Provider. I'll login as Mary today, and hit Continue. We'll type in a password. I'll press Continue again, and we can see if I press my Open Popup button, in this case, it's just opening a view as a Popup. But even if you don't have this button here, you can always click on the little App Bar at the bottom of the session. And if we take a look at this center item here, we click on it, we can see that we're logged in as a particular user. And of course, if we needed to logout, you press the Logout button, which will call our Logout action, reloads the session, but of course I am no longer logged in. Right, again, if we check to see who I'm logged in as, I am now unauthenticated. So that should give you a good idea about what the Login action and the Logout action do.

                                    In this lesson we'll talk about the Refresh Action. The Refresh Action provides you a very simplistic way to refresh your page from one of your components. To begin with we'll grab a component from the Component Palette and if we collapse all of the different categories here under the Input category we have the Button component. We'll use this to trigger the Refresh Action. As with all actions we'll right click on our component, go down to Configure Events, and then we'll need to specify an event that will trigger our action. So I want my users to be able to refresh by pressing the button so we'll use the On Click action. Now that we have an event we can hit the plus button here and we'll select the Refresh Action. Now the Refresh Action is very simplistic, there's not a whole lot to configure. So we're ready to try it out. Let's hit okay. Let's save our project. Now this view I have configured here, named Refresh Action, I actually have, if I click on the cog icon at the bottom, I already have a page configured to show this view in my session. So we'll right click on the page and select Launch URL. So we see our session. If I press my button you'll notice that it's refreshing my page in the browser. So if for some reason I didn't want my users to hit refresh on their browser we can simply use the Refresh Action.

                                    The Ignition Perspective App has the ability to take advantage of special features of smartphones or other mobile devices. The Scan Barcode Action can make use of a mobile device's built in camera. Here I have simple view that contains a Label and a Button. The Label simply has a binding on its text property. The binding is pointing at the new tag that I have set up, which has the phrase "Please scan a barcode". The Button which says "Scan Barcode" has an onClick event configured with the action Scan Barcode. If you want you can configure a barcode type, or leave it to look for any type of barcode. Now this action simply turns on the camera and allows us to scan a barcode, but what we actually do with that barcode data is determined by a script somewhere else within the project. This script is located in the Session Event scripts, which we can access by going into the Project menu, and then selecting "Session Events". Here we have a Barcode Scanned event, which we can use to handle the incoming data whenever we scan a barcode. Here we have a very simple script that I've set up. Barcodes can contain a lot of different information, but I know the barcode that I've created simply contains some text. My script here is simply taking that text and writing that value to the new tag that I have set up, that's bound to my Label. I have an emulated mobile device set up, that's already running my project where we can test this out. I'm going to go ahead and click on the "Scan Barcode" Button, and if this is the first time you're trying to use the camera from the Perspective project, you may get a prompt that looks something like this. Like most other apps, the Ignition Perspective app needs to ask for permission before it can use various features of your mobile device. I'm going to go ahead and click "Allow" so that we can use the camera. We see my barcode there on the table, and Ignition will scan that barcode. You'll notice once it was able to identify the barcode it scanned in its data, which my script then used to write that text to my tag. Since my tag updated, my Label then showed the new tag value, which simply says "Perspective is great!" While this was a relatively simple example, barcodes can hold almost any type of information, so you can imagine I can scan a barcode that might return some data about a product that I'm currently looking at. I can then use my script to take that data and push it somewhere like tags, or even a database.

                                    - With the Ignition Perspective App, we can utilize various built-in features of your mobile device, such as near field communications, or NFC. Most mobile devices are set to automatically scan for NFC tags, but Ignition Perspective projects can pull that information in and use the data in some way. Here I have a simple view with a Button and a Label. The Label has a binding on its text property, and it is looking at the NFC data tag that I've set up. On my Button's onClick event I then have a Scan Ndef NFC Action. Like I mentioned earlier, most mobile devices continuously scan for NFC tags anyways. What this action allows us to do is it allows us to capture the data within the NFC tag and use it some meaningful way instead of doing the default behavior of that NFC tag. The mode property determines how we want to scan. Single will capture a single NFC tag scan before reverting back to the mobile device's default behavior. While the continuous mode will continuously capture all NFC tag events until it is stopped by the similar Off mode action. In which case, it will revert back to the mobile device's default behavior. Now when we capture the data from the NFC tag, we need to do something with it. We can actually build a script that determines how we handle that data. This script is configured in our session events. So I'm going to go up into my Project menu and go down to the Session Events option. You can see here I have a simple event, where I can pull the data out of the NFC tag. The NFC tag that I have here with me typically takes the user to the demo project that we have set up. However, because I'm capturing this data, what I'm doing instead is I'm extracting the string output from that NFC tag. So it's simply going to display the path to the demo project. I'm then writing that to my NFC data tag. Let's go ahead and give this a shot. Now I do have an emulator set up, however because I have a physical NFC tag, I can't actually show you the tag being scanned by this phone. However, I have my physical phone that's looking at this Perspective project as well, and if I scan the NFC tag with my phone, you can see that the Label updates to show the information that was held within the NFC tag, which in this case is the path to the demo project. Like barcodes, these NFC tags can be placed around your facility at different points that hold information that you can pull in and push to tags or put it in a database.

                                    When using the Ignition Perspective App you have the ability to grab data from the mobile device's various systems such as the accelerometer. While the accelerometer on your phone is typically always on, you have to enable Ignition to pull in that data. To do this you can use an Accelerometer action. I have a button here with an onClick event which has an accelerometer action configured on it. Now there are three modes to the accelerometer action. Continuous mode and Off mode go hand in hand. When you run an accelerometer action at continuous mode it will pull in accelerometer data at the sample rate and will continue to do so until a similar accelerometer action in Off mode stops it. Batch works a little bit differently in that it runs at the sample rate pulling in accelerometer data every however often you specify and it will only last for the duration that you set up here in the action.

**[01:16]** [01:16]
                                    So in this example my action is going to sample accelerometer data every 100 milliseconds and it's going to do that for 200 milliseconds so I'm going to get two different readings. Now where this data is made available depends on the mode that the action is in. For batch mode, the accelerometer data is actually passed into a Session Event script, I'm gonna go up into my Project menu, select the Session Events option and go down to the Accelerometer Data Received event. Here in the script we can parse out the data object to get at the list of accelerometer data. In continuous mode the accelerometer data will continuously be captured at the sample rate by session properties that are set up to capture them.

**[02:08]** [02:08]
                                    You will notice in the session props we have a device property and then an accelerometer property which contains X, Y and Z properties as well as a timestamp. If we go back to my view and I take a look at my button we can see that it's in Continuous mode which means the data is going to continuously feed into those session props. This is why on my view I have three different Label components. Each Label has an Expression Binding on its text property that is looking at one of the appropriate accelerometer properties X Y or Z. I have an emulated mobile device where we can test this out. You'll notice that my Y value starts out with 9.81. And that's because my accelerometer is being pulled down in that direction by the force of gravity.

**[03:04]** [03:04]
                                    If I go into my menu here I can actually change what rotation my device is at. Now I still haven't clicked my button yet so you'll notice that if I move my device to the side my accelerometer data has changed but it doesn't update on the Perspective application. This is because I haven't told Perspective to start grabbing that data just yet. Once I click on my button to start grabbing accelerometer data. It's going to pull in those new records into my X and Y values. You'll notice that these values change as I move my device around.

                                    Perspective's input components allow your users to interact directly with the screen. There are Entry Fields, Sliders, Buttons and more. We are going to take a look at some of the commonly used ones in this video. Now the first component that I want to add is the Toggle Switch. This is one of the simplest components. It just has a selected property which is either true or false, if the switch is left or right. And it also has a label property that has both text and position. I'll add some text here, switch, and then you can see that it shows up. Now if I stretch my component up a little bit it will look better. Here we go. And if I change my position from right to left, then you can see the text switches sides. The next component that I want to take a look at is the Numeric Entry Field. If I drop one of these guys on the screen, then you can see we have a value property and I can type in whatever I want here, 45.3. And you can see that my format is having two decimal places here. And I can change that if I want, so let's display it as an integer. And I can also set input bounds so something like zero and 100 as my minimum and maximum, so that way, if I were to type a value in, above or below those, so, let's say 102, then the value goes back to what it was. This component also has three different modes, direct, protected and button. Protected just means you have to double click in order to type in, and button means you have this little button next to your number. If I click on the button, you can see we get this little popup and I can change my value using these up or down buttons, or by typing in directly, and then hit 'Apply' to submit. There's also a placeholder text, I can type in here, "Enter a Value", and anytime we have a value that is null, you'll see that placeholder text over the component. The next component I wanna talk about is the slider. I'll go out of preview mode here and I'll grab a slider component and drop it on the screen. Now, if I make this component a little bit larger here, and go back into preview mode, you can see that this is just a handle for me to click and drag, and you'll see that my value property is changing. With a minimum and a maximum, or left and right, being zero to 100. I can also change my orientation from horizontal to vertical. I can change the step, so that my value move in increments of that number. I can also set labels, and I can set the interball of those labels. And, if you want to, you can change the handle colors to whatever you like. Now, I'm gonna take another component out here. Take it out of preview mode and I'm gonna grab my radio group, and drop this guy on the screen. You can see it shows up with a single radio button, but it has a radios property, it has one entry here I can add a couple of more array elements, and you can see now I have zero, one and two, with three different radio buttons. You can see my radios two, I can change my text here. I'll say number three. And if I change my selected to true, then you can see that one becomes true. Now, I can also set a value, I'll say 12. So then you can see the value and index property up above, show me the value associated with what I have selected, and the index of the radio button that I have selected. I can also change the orientation of my row, so I'll go to column. But you can see it doesn't show very much here. If I make my component wider and then shorter, then you can see how our third radio button wraps. If I change my orientation back to row, you can see that the number three is now on the bottom, it goes left to right, top to bottom. And, of course, you can change the text position, so you can say I want my text on top of my radio buttons. The last component I want to talk about is the multi-state button. I'm gonna drag a multi-state button on the screen here, and you can see it shows up as 'hand', 'off' and 'auto' as the three buttons, and those correspond to the three states, zero, one and two. I can change my text from hand to, maybe, machine? So, the way this button works is, when you press the machine button it will set a value of two to the controlValue property. If I go into preview mode, and then click the machine button, you can see nothing really happens, but our controlValue has been set to two. The problem is the indicatorValue is the one that changes which button is displayed as active. So, what I'll do, is I'll take this 'WriteableInteger1' tag, and I'll drag it onto my indicatorValue, and I'll do the same, drag it onto my controlValue as well. Now, one small thing we need to do, is I need to go onto my binding here, on my controlValue, and make sure that 'Bidirectional' is set, so that way, when we write to the value, it will write to the tag. So I'll hit 'OK' here and I'm still in preview mode. Now I can click on my machine button, sets my controller value to two, which ends up setting my integer value as well. I can go to auto, and it'll set them both to one. There are more input components than I've mentioned here, I encourage you to try them out and play with some of the properties and get familiar with all of them.

                                    In this lesson, we'll talk about the Embedded View component in the Perspective Module. The Embedded View component allows you to place one view inside of another. To begin with, I have two views down below. I have my bigger view, and then I have my smaller view. The smaller view has a label, and a slightly different background color. I would like to embed this smaller view into the bigger view. To begin with, we'll head over to the bigger view. We'll head over to the Component Palette. And under the Embedding category, we have the Embedded View component. I'll drag an instance of this component onto my bigger view. You can see that there's a warning on the component. That's because we haven't specified a path to a particular view that this project has access to. So we can head up to the Property Editor, and under the props category, we have the path property which is actually a drop down, so if you click on the little triangle here, you'll see all of the available views. Now in this case, we are on the bigger view. If I select the bigger view here, so I'm placing an instance of the bigger view inside of itself and hit okay we'll get a different message. So you can't embed a view inside of itself. So we'll head back to the path property, and we'll switch the bigger view over to the smaller view and we'll hit okay. And you can see that it's now displaying our smaller view inside of the component. Now in this case I'm getting a scroll bar because the width of the label here is partially hidden by the view port on my Embedded View. So of course I could resize my Embedded View. The scroll bars appear based off the dimensions and configurations of the smaller view. So for example if we go back to our smaller view, you can see that it's only about 200 pixels tall but my component is considerably larger. So if we go back to my bigger view here, when we try to use the rulers here, you can see that the height here is set to over 300 pixels. Now when you have the Embedded View component selected, if you look in the Property Editor, you can see that there are some default settings here. So we can force the component to use the default height and width of your view. So if I were to check the useDefaultViewHeight, you can see that the height of the view, that's inside of the Embedded View component, is only 200 pixels. Next, I want to talk about passing parameters into the Embedded View. Now on my smaller view here, I did mention that I have a Label component, and the Label component here has its text property bound to on my view, the smaller view, this params property here called myText. So on the view I can change the value of my text, and we'll see the new text on the component. So if you have these params properties configured on your views, the Embedded View component provides you access to these parameters. So if we go back to our bigger view, and if I select my Embedded View component here, under the params property I can specify any params properties that are on the Embedded View. So I'll hit the plus icon here, I'll create a value member, and I want the key to match the name that's on my smaller view, so I'll type in my text. Now when I hit enter, you'll notice that the text on the Embedded View changes immediately, so now I can type whatever I want and pass this value in to my Embedded View. So ideally, you can start using bindings or scripts to change the value of these params properties. So hopefully that gives you a good idea about what the Embedded View component can do.

                                    In this lesson, we're going to be talking about the Flex Repeater. The Flex Repeater has layout settings like a Flex Container, except it allows you to display multiple instances of a single view instead of adding components. Now I already have a view created that we can use so let's take a look at it. This small view just has a great background and a label component on it and the label component is just bound to the display parameter here so we can pass information in. Now let's go back to our main view and we'll add a Flex Repeater. I'll go to my perspective components and I'll filter it out and I'll grab a Flex Repeater and drag it onto the screen. Now the two main properties of the Flex Repeater component are the path and instances. The path property allows you to select which view will go into your Flex Repeater. I'll select the small view and hit okay. Now you'll notice that the small view didn't actually appear but this is because the instances property controls how many instances we have.

**[01:07]** [01:07]
                                    I'll click on the add array element button here and you can see an instance populates in the Flex Repeater. Now you'll notice if I go and change the size of my Flex Repeater, it won't actually affect the size of the view that's inside of it. That's because the Flex Repeater component is telling all the internal views to use their default view width and height. To allow the view to change size with the Flex Repeater, we just want to deselect the use default view width and use default view height. So let's add another instance to the repeater and go up to instances and press the little plus icon and you can see now we have two. And if we want to pass a parameter into the view, all we have to do is add a new parameter next to the instance number one and choose value. Now when I change the key to match the small view param, you can see that the text changes this to value. Now we can pass any parameter values into the views and that's pretty neat.

**[02:03]** [02:03]
                                    You may have noticed that there are several style properties in the Flex Repeater and they're actually three places that you can set the style. So one is the instant style. So for each instance that's in the Flex Repeater, I can go and change the styles. So I'll change the background color here. We'll make it maybe something a light red, and then you can see that that particular instance is changing. We can also change the styles of all of the instances at the same time, by going to the element style property. And I'll add a margin to my views here, something like 10 pixels and you can see the margin applied to all of the views. Lastly, there's a style for the Flex Repeater and that's applied to the entire component. I'll add a border here, just something simple and you can see it goes around the entire Flex Repeater. The Flex Repeater also has alignment properties, just like a Flex Container. We can set the wrap property to be wrap. And when we do that, we also want to make sure and set the use default view width to true so that way, the components know how wide they're supposed to be.

**[03:11]** [03:11]
                                    Now when we resize the Flex Repeater, you can see that the views will stack. We can also change the layout of the container so that we have a scrollable list of components. If I set the use default view height to true, and then I change the height of my Flex Repeater, then you can see that when there's not enough room, we'll get a scroll bar to show all the views. And you can even scroll through them in the design mode with the mouse wheel. This is great for showing many views in a small space. The Flex Repeater is great for showing a dynamic number of instances. To do this, we just need to fill in the instances property with the binding or script. Now I already have a database query setup, so we can just use that. Let's go to the instance property and click on the binding icon and we'll select a query binding type. Now I'll select my named query, get areas and then hit select.

**[04:04]** [04:04]
                                    And I'm going to change my return format to JSON. Now I could leave it at auto but if you change it to JSON, then the instances property will look like we see under props. Now when we go and click okay, you can see that our three instances will show up. And if I resize my Flex Repeater, you can see them all at once. Of course, our named query could be much more complex. It could join tables and return many parameters to populate the view instances. We could also add components to our view like dropdown lists or entry fields to allow users to select which data they want the Flex Repeater to display.

                                    In this lesson, we'll talk about the Carousel component. The Carousel is a way to show one or more views based off of user selection. We'll begin by heading over to the perspective component pallet and under the Embedding category we'll grab a Carousel component and place that on the view. We'll start with the view's property. We see element zero which I'll expand and there's a whole host of properties down here. The view's array allows you to specify one or more views as well as some configurations associated with them. The view path property determines which view should be positioned at this element. We can click the drop down and see a list of available views in our project. I'll select View A and press okay. We now see there's a view inside of the Carousel. If we add more array elements, we can specify another view to be placed inside of the Carousel. So I'll select View B here and click okay. We now see on the component there are some dots at the bottom as well as some arrows on the side. These allow us to look at the different views. So if we enter preview mode by clicking the play button at the top of our designer, I can click and drag my views. I can also click on the dots at the bottom or by clicking on the arrows. Now you may notice that there's a slight delay in the transition, that's determined by the transition speed property. The value here is the number of milliseconds it takes to transition. So if we reduce the value on the property, it transitions faster. If we increase the value on this property, it transitions slower. Notice I have scroll bars in my views here. That's due to the configuration of my views. Right now the Carousel is trying to use the default width and height. We can change this or override it with the use default views properties. So if I disable these properties, it means the views have to use the layout and dimensions of the Carousel. Now back on the views property, let's add another array element. I'll click the drop down again and under my smaller views folder, I'll select View C, so a third view and hit okay. Now that I have three, we'll scroll down in the property editor and talk about the slides to show property. If I increase this, my component now shows multiple views simultaneously. Although, I still transition one at a time. I'll set this back to one for right now. Now let's talk about view parameters or viewparams. View C here has a label as well as a view parameter. If we head back to View C at the bottom of the designer and we have the view selected, we can see under the params category I have a property called display with a value of hello. The label on this view has its text property bound to display. So when we're working back with our Carousel, if we take the designer back into design mode I can select the Carousel. Under the views property, we'll expand element two, which has View C inside of it and we see this view params property. If I expand this, we can add an object member. Display was a value member so I'll add a value member and I'll type in the name of my view param, which was display. Once I hit enter we can see that the value on the property and the Carousel are now synchronized so I can type something here and it shows up on the view inside of the Carousel. So now because we have these view params I can place a binding on display here and have its value automatically update based on user selection or some other criteria. So that was a brief overview of the Carousel component. It's a very easy way to show multiple views within a very small amount of space.

                                    In this lesson, we'll talk about the menu tree component. The menu tree component is a navigation component that allows you to navigate your users to different pages, as well as external URLs. Now, this lesson is going to make heavy use of pages. I'm going to head back to that cog icon here, or the home of the perspective module, and we're going to be talking about these pages in some depth. So, for more information on creating pages and what they are, please take a look at the Pages video. I have a view called West Dock, which has been configured as a docked view under shared settings. So, we'll always see our menu tree on all of our different pages. Let's get started, we'll head over to the West Dock view, and from the Component palette here, under Navigation, I'm going to grab a menu tree component and drag that onto my view. So, the way this component works is that there's a series of items' properties you can configure that just add more elements or items into the menu tree. So, if I put the designer into Preview mode, if I click on Menu Item 1, we transition to a submenu with submenu item one and item two. And then, of course, there is a Back button at the top. So, the actual structure of this content on the component, if I look in the Property Editor under PROPS, there's an items property. We have two elements here. If I look at element zero, we can see that there's a bunch of properties in here, including a label, which shows us Menu Item 1. So, this element here represents Menu Item 1. Menu Item 1 also has an items property, which if we drill down into, we have different elements. Again, they have a similar structure here. Again, if I go to label, this is submenu item one. You can actually continue this entire process, you can just keep adding new items, which then gives you additional submenus under any given item. So, this can be as deep or as shallow as you want to make it. Now, before I go too deep, let's start at the top. Instead of working with any of these submenus, let's just add a new item. So, for the items property here, the Add Array Element button, I'll just press that. We can see that it added a new element, it has a pre-defined schema, so there's a bunch of properties already configured. We see the new item exists on the component. Now, the default items don't have any sort of navigation associated with them because they don't have any targets defined. So, for my target here, if I wanted to go to one of my pages, you type / and then the name of the mounted page, which in my case, is a capital A. We can change the text under the label property here, so let's go ahead and just put some text on there. So, we'll type Page A, and we see it on the component now. Now, there's other things we can do here, there's icons and such, but I'm not going to mess around with those. But of course, the default example does. Now, as we saw earlier, items allows us to navigate to external web addresses. So, why don't we try that right now? I'm going to add a new array element here, and this time, I'm actually going to set the target to one of my favorite websites. We know in the designer, if we go to Help and Help, that always opens your browser, and then attempts to navigate to the Ignition User Manual. I'm simply going to copy the address here. I'll close my browser, we'll come back to this in a moment. For the target here, I'll simply right-click and paste. Now, in most cases, you probably want to take off the extra junk at the end there, but for these external addresses, in the very least, you want to make sure you have the HTTP or HTTPS, as well as all of those characters at the start. So, we'll hit OK, we'll make sure that we add a label for this new item here, just so it stands out. And let's test it out, we will save our project. Let's go to Tools, we'll launch a session, and again, my West Dock view is configured as a docked view under shared settings, so it should be there once the session starts. I'll click on Page A because there's a target. You see that it takes us to my Page A. If I click on Help, which is the external address, it actually opens it as a new tab and takes us back to that address. So, from this menu tree here, you can actually make one application, and then redirect to even stuff that's outside of Ignition. Now, if you wanted to add some sort of navigation to the sub-items, that's actually the exact same process. So, for my Menu Item 2 here, which should be element one, and again, we can always confirm by taking a look at the label. We see the name here matches up to that item there. You simply need to find the items property under the elements, and then of course, we can start making some changes here, I can supply a target. So, how about this first item will take us to the Home page of our project, and the second one here will take us to Page A. And again, if we try that, we'll save, we'll go to Tools, Launch Perspective, get another session going. And just like we saw the first time, I should be able to go to Menu Item 2. This should take us to the Home, which we're already at. This one should take us to Page A, and then we can try our Home button there. Now, that should give you a good idea on how to get started with the menu tree, but as you can see, it's very easy to configure and it provides a nice, clean interface to navigate around your project.

                                    There are a lot of ways to display information in Ignition and one of the components that is new in perspective is the map component. With it you can give your users a map similar to what you would find online or on your phone. They can move around and zoom in and out and it supports multi touch commands on a mobile device. You can even put markers and pop-ups on the map with additional information. Let's take a look. Here I have a map already configured on screen. If I go and put my designer into preview mode, you can see that I can click and drag around. I can zoom in and out, with the plus and minus buttons or with my mouse wheel and we can see in the properties here that I have some initial location like my center, latitude and longitude and my zoom and I also have the ability to control how I zoom. So whether the controls are on or off, if I can use my scroll wheel or double click and so on. Now the most important property on this component is the layers property. You can see down here, that it's a complex property and these little blue markers here mean that I already have binding set up. Let's take a look at one of the simple ones first. I'm going to expand the vector property and the circle property and you can see that I have one circle on my screen and I have a radius of 1000 and if I go to my circles here, then you can see we have latitude and longitude. So that's this blue circle right there. I also have a couple of pop-ups here. One for Highway 50 and one for Historic Folsom and you can see that they're bound to these check-boxes. If I go into my EUI property and then under pop-up then you can see I have my zero and one and each of these are bound on the enabled property and have our latitude and longitude showing. One being my being Historic Folsom and under content, I have just some simple text the words, Historic Folsom. Now I also have a more complex marker set up that's this one here. If I mouse over the marker you can see it says Inductive Automation on it and if I click on it then you can see that it pops up a special pop-up. This is in fact a whole new view that I have configured down below here. Now let's take a look at that marker. I can go into my marker property and you can see I've only got the one, so it's item zero. Its name's IA headquarters and it has the latitude and longitude. Now what makes this one particularly special is the pop-up property. Under pop-up and then content, then view you can see that I have a path to my page/HQ. And I even have some params in here that I can pass in. So what I can do, I can type in here, Global Headquarters and you can see that the text pops into my little pop-up. Now this is just starting to scratch the surface of what you can do with the map component. Any of this can be made dynamic by binding these properties individually or you can bind the entire UI property to something like a database table.

                                    In this lesson, I'll demonstrate how to use and configure the Google Map component that was added to Perspective. The Google Map can be found in the Perspective Component Palette under Display. When I first drag the component onto one of my views, I'll see a message telling me that this page can't load Google Maps correctly. That's because it requires an API key to function properly, and this is something that you'll have to get from Google. I have my API key ready, so now I can head over to the Perspective session props, and if I scroll down, I can paste it into the googleMapsApiKey prop here. I'll head back over to my view and now my component is working properly. The component is a new interactive map alternative to the existing Perspective leaflet map. However, this one uses the Google Maps API and allows for additional scriptable interactions and layer configurations. If I look at the list of properties for the Google Map, I can configure the initial state and location that the map will load with. I can modify the appearance of the cursor when the map is draggable or being dragged.

**[01:05]** [01:05]
                                    I can expose the end user controls, for example, I can display or hide the button to make the map full screen or to zoom in or out. Also, if I want to control the bounds of the map, that's something I can specify with the north, east, south, west coordinates in the restriction object, and that will restrict the map within those boundaries. The Google Maps API allows for the configuration of many different layers, such as markers, shapes, and bike, traffic, or transit paths. I'll copy and paste a quick example into my props and you'll see that there's now a marker with a filled in circular area and invisible bike paths. On top of this, there's also KML layers that allow you to configure clickable icons across the map with additional data. This works by specifying a URL to A KML file that will be parsed for rendering. Check out the Google developer docs for more information on those as well as some examples.

**[02:04]** [02:04]
                                    In addition, I can add bindings to these properties to further customize or control the behavior or appearance of the map. For example, I could bind the maptype ID to my dropdown to give users the ability to interact with my view to change whether this displays a roadmap or a satellite image. But I could also do things like bind coordinates of the initial state of the map to a tag. It can be bound to the results of a database query, or it can also be controlled by end users to possibly view the location of different sites around the globe. Even more customization can be achieved through the numerous events tied to this component. You can trigger popups to open or scripts to fire on anything from the map bounds updating to each individual kind of layer being clicked, dragged, or loaded. To reference the full list of properties and scripting functions available for this component, check out the pages in our user manual, which I'll link below the video.

                                    The Perspective table component has some neat features that offers some powerful functionality. Now when you first drag a table component on to your view, you'll notice that there's quite a few properties listed in our property editor. As you can imagine, going over all of these properties in a video is going to be really difficult. So as always, you can find more information about the table component in our user manual. Now, one of the most important things about my table component is its data. As what's a table without some data? You'll notice up at the top of my property editor, we find my data property which lets me know that there are 50 records within my table. If I expand my data property, it lists out all of my records in index order. So, this record at zero is going to refer to the first row of Folsom, United States. While the second record at record one is going to refer to the row of Helsinki, Finland. Now, you'll notice that my two records here look a little bit different. For record one, the city, country, and population are simply values that hold the city, country, and population of Helsinki, Finland. However, record zero for Folsom, United States, looks a little bit different. You'll notice that the city is not a value but instead an object which contains other values and objects within it. This is how you can customize the behavior of individual cells within the table. You'll notice because the city object has an editable value inside of it, this particular cell is going to allow me to edit it. It also has a style object which is why the cell for Folsom comes in as a different color. Now, there are two ways to add a new record. First, we can right-click on one of my existing records and go to insert a new object. This is going to insert a new blank object record. So you'll notice now, I have a new record at index two, and it has no items in it. If I wanted it to match with my other rows, I would need to provide that object with values city, country, and population as well as their respective values. It's important to note that what you fill each record with is really up to you. You can insert other values like city and country and population or you can insert in entire objects like style, to change how the cell or row looks, or even objects such as another view. There's a lot of possibilities with each of these cells within the table. Alternately, if I right-click on an existing record, I can also go to duplicate. Duplicate is going to create a duplicate of the record that I had right-clicked on, so now I have two records for Helsinki, Finland. I can simply change the values of one of them with my new values for my new record. Now, one of the really neat features of the table component is its builtin pagination system. You can see by default the table automatically splits up my data in to multiple pages instead of displaying all the data in a long list. If I minimize my data property and scroll down in my property list, we can see that there is an object called pager. In the pager object, there's a lot of other properties and objects where I can configure how the pagination system works within the table. I can alter how many records are initially shown, I can change the location of my pager to be at the top of my table, or I can even hide the pagination system entirely and not use it. These features and more help make the Perspective table component a really powerful asset to your Perspective projects.

                                    In this lesson, we'll take a look at the Perspective Dashboard component, a special component, with some pretty unique features. The dashboard component allows users to design their interface from inside the session using widgets that you provide. So to see what I mean here, I have a session already open with the dashboard component on it. And for right now its not too exciting, its just a big empty space, but at the bottom of my big empty space, I have a little pencil icon. And if I click that icon, that will put my dashboard into the edit mode, meaning I can now customize how my dashboard should look. To do that, all I have to do is select one of these rectangles and click that plus button and I'll be prompted to add a widget into that slot. Now for this example, I've set up two widgets already. So I have a map widget and a table widget. So how about I add a table widget here. So I'll select table and then say 'add'. And what that'll do is it'll slot that widget into my grid. Now a widget as it pertains to the dashboard component is basically just a dressed up view. And we'll be taking a view at how we can create widgets in just a bit. But for now, now that I have this widget in here, I can use the anchors to resize it if I like, I can make it bigger or smaller or I can click and drag to make move my widget around. So maybe I'll move my table widget to the left hand side and make it take up the full vertical space of my session. And then maybe on the right hand side I'll add my other widget, so I'll click that plus icon select map, and then click add and then I'll resize my map to be just a little bit bigger and then once I'm happy with where my widgets are I can click the little play button and now I'm just using the dashboard as an end user. So its important to keep in mind here again I am not in the designer right now all of the design work that I've just done took place within a perspective session. So the dashboard can be a great choice if you're trying to give your end users control over what they see of if, say, you want the supervisor to be able to control what their operators see. The dashboard component can give you that option. Now that we've seen how our dashboard component plays out in a real session, lets look at how this component is set up in the designer. So I have my designer open right behind here. And this is the view we were just working with in the session. So we can see our dashboard's properties on the right hand side here. And there's one in particular that I'd like to take a look at, which is this available widgets property. This is where we can figure the list of widgets that are available in that add widget menu. So if I expand one of my widgets here each widget is just looking at some perspective view. So the first step behind creating a widget is to create a view with the information you'd like to have on it. We also have the ability to pass parameters into the view. We have default and minimum size options. So my min size property is going to specify how small I can make this widget In terms of rows and columns. And after that I can put my widget into a category, I can give it a name, I can customize it's header, and so on. So before we dive too much deeper into the settings let's try creating a third widget here. So I'm going to collapse that widget. And then, under available widgets, I'm going to click that little plus icon to add another element. Now this time I'm going to add an alarm status widget into my dashboard. In fact, I already have a view set up for this. So under view path, I'm going to select alarms and the click 'okay'. I already have the alarms view up so lets take a look at it here. My alarms view is pretty simple, it's just an alarm status table, showing all the active alarms in my system. There is one thing special about this view though this view takes a parameter called configuring, the name on that is very important as we will see in a second. And all that does is, when you set it to true, there's a drop down component appearing up at the top that allows you to select and filter on a specific machine's alarms. So the reason that I've added this is because of some very specific functionality built into the dashboard. So if I go back into my dashboard view, here and then I select my dashboard that widget that I had started on has an 'isConfigurable' property and I'm going to go ahead and set that to true. What that's going to do is its going to allow me to toggle that configuring parameter from my dashboard so we will test that out in just a moment. Everything else in here, I'll leave pretty much alone except I'll make sure to I've my widget a name. So I'll call it alarms. And then I'll go ahead and save my project. Next let's go back into our session and see our new widget in action. So starting fresh again, I'll go ahead and select the cell then select that alarms widget and click add. Next, ill go ahead and make it a little bigger. And we can see that unlike before, we have a little pencil icon up at the top. What it's actually going to do is pass a value of true onto that configuring parameter. Which again I've set up to control visibility on our drop down here, and allow us to select a specific machine. And if I unselect that pencil icon, the setting will actually stick. So now I'm only seeing machine 8's alarms. And now if I toggle back out of edit mode here that setting will stick in my real run time as well. So effectively that 'isConfigurable' option has allowed us to configure an alarm display for any one of our machines. So this concludes our brief overview of the dashboard component. Obviously, there are a lot of settings here we didn't really get into and we encourage you to check out our user manual for more info.

                                    In this lesson, we'll take a look at the file upload component. This component allows the user of the perspective session to send files from their own system to the Gateway for processing. You will have an opportunity to process those files however you'd like, including pushing them into a database or saving them onto the Gateway's file system and so on. So for starters, I have a file upload component here and it's currently telling me to browse or drag files here. So if I were to click that browse button, what it would do is open up a file menu that I can use to choose a file to upload. In a bit, we'll look at how we can actually process that uploaded file. There are some properties that dictate how the component behaves. For one, there is this max uploads property here that'll dictate how many uploads can happen simultaneously. So if we were already uploading five very large files, no more uploads would be accepted until one of those five is complete. We also have a supported file types property, which is an array, and each element of that array is simply a file extension that the component should allow. If we have nothing in that array, all file types are accepted, but once I start adding elements, only those files will be accepted. So my file upload component will only accept PDF files under the current configuration. Next, we have a file size limit property. That allows us to specify a max file upload size in megabytes so any files larger than 10 megabytes will not be accepted. And then finally, we have a file upload icon property here. That might seem a little bit strange since there is an icon selected in there, but it's not being shown on the component at all, but one thing that's worth keeping in mind on the component is that there are built in break points. So if I grab one of the anchors of my components and shrink the component to be narrower, eventually the component is now rendered using just a single icon, which is what that file upload icon property is getting at. So that's how the component is configured. Let's switch over to my file upload view here to see it in action. So now we're going to get into how the file upload component actually processes the uploaded files. So for this example, I've created a table in my database called files, and I have a table component here that's fetching the contents of that table. I, of course, have another file upload component up here. This one, I've configured to accept only text files, but all the other properties are pretty much the same. So to get into how the file upload component will actually process the uploaded file, I'm going to right click on the component and then go to Configure Events. So the file upload component relies on two very specific component events seen on the left here. So these are special events specific to the file upload component. So the one I'm using here is on file received. This will be called whenever a user uploads a file. So on that event, I've configured a script action, which is the action of choice. You will almost certainly need to use a script action in combination with this component. This script action will dictate how we respond to the file upload. Now for this example, I've gotten about 80% of my script done already. My goal here is just to pass file information into the database table that I've made and the query to actually do that is already happening. All that I need to do is configure lines three, four, and five here to actually work. So one thing that's very special about this component event is that the event object that we're passed has some very specific properties on it pertaining to the file that was uploaded. For instance, if I need to get the file name here, meaning the name of the file that was uploaded, I can just type event.file.name. Next, if I want to get the contents of the file as a string, all I have to type is events.file.getString and that is a function that will return the file's contents as a UTF-8 encoded string. If I wanted to, I could pass a parameter to that function that would change the encoding. UTF-8 is just the default. Finally, I also want to fetch the actual bytes from the file. Meaning the actual raw file data. If you were uploading something other than a text file, the actual bytes of the file are probably going to be what's most useful to you. For instance, if you are uploading images, the getString function is just going to return garbage. Whereas event.file.getBytes will get you the raw image data you're looking for. So the rest of my script here is just passing data into our database and refreshing the table component to reflect that data that's coming through. By the way, the other component event here, onUploadsCleared, will run when the user has cleared all uploads. I'm ready to see my script in action, so I'll click okay at the bottom here and then I'll go into preview mode. I'll save my project, and then I'll click on browse here. And then I've set up a couple of simple little text files to work with, so I'll select myfile and then click open. And it looks like we've been successful, so my table's set up to pull back the name of the file as well as the actual text contents, which in this case is just the word test, as well as the date associated with the upload.

                                    In this lesson, we'll take a look at the view canvas component. A free form component that allows us to customize the locations of nested views in space. We'll walk through just a simple example here. I've got a view called hexagon that just contains a single hexagon and I'll be showing an instance of that view on this view here. I'll start by pulling in a view canvas component from the component pallets. And once it's in, I'll configure a grow value of one so that it takes up all space in the view. Now much like the flex repeater, accordion, and carousel components, we're given this instances array in the properties, which allows us to create instances of whatever views we'd like. The first thing I'm going to do for this instance is find the view path field and set that to my hexagon shape. And just like that it'll appear in my view and now I have a few different options for where I'd like the view to appear on my canvas. So how about I start with this position prop here. If I set this to absolute, then all of the coordinate properties below it are evaluated in relation to the bounds of the view canvas. If I set it to relative, they're all evaluated in relation to the previous view instance that's also marked relative. Allowing you to string together different components in a chain. From there, we have four properties detailing how the view should be positioned. So if I set top and left to 100 pixels each, the view will appear 100 pixels offset from the top and left corners of the screen. Next step, we have a Z index, which details which view should appear on top in case of collisions, with the highest number winning out. After that, we have some width and height properties that will dictate the size of the view, provided the use default view with and use default view height properties are turned off below. Now that we've talked about some of the basic positioning of views on a view canvas, we're ready to discuss what happens when those position properties change. The view canvas is built to render the movement of views around the canvas space. So let's put together a little example to show that off. I'm going to take my hexagon view here and set up a binding on the top property. I'm going to make this an expression binding and write an expression that moves this view every second. So something like, if, get second, now 1000, % two. So every second this expression is going to take the current timestamp, extract the seconds field, and calculate the remainder of that field divided by two, which is going to flip flop between zero and one and so if that's one, we're going to say 500 PX in quotes. And if it's zero, we're going to say zero PX in quotes. And then a closed parenthesis at the end. So to see this in action, we can click okay. And now we can see that our view alternates between positions at a one second rate. In the property editor, we can find a transition settings property that allows us to customize how long the transition between states takes and allow us to change the timing function. Now there are a few different options here, but if I change it from linear to something like ease, we can see that that affects how the view moves between two positions. So that about wraps up the basics behind the view canvas components. It's an open sandbox component for customizing exactly how you'd like views to appear and even move inside your perspective session.

                                    In this video, we are going to take a look at the perspective symbols. The perspective symbols are fully-immersive graphical components that are found in the Perspective Component pallet under the Symbols section. Pulling inspiration from both the display components as well as SVGs, the symbols offer the ability to display various values while also containing a graphical element. With each symbol, it contains properties that allow you to not just modify the component, but modify the graphic within. For example, while I can determine what the label and value of this pump says as well as the location of the text, I can also change the variant of the pump to a vacuum pump, and it will change the graphic that represents it. In addition, each symbol has a state property, which when changed, will alter the animation of the symbol. For example, if I change this state property of the pump to running, we can see that the pump begins flashing to indicate that is currently running. The animation on each graphic differs depending on the symbol that you've used. For example, on the vessel component, if I were to change the state property to running, we can see that the blades start mixing the contents within.

                                    In this lesson, we'll talk about the XY chart in the Perspective Module. The XY chart is a fantastic chart to use if you're trying to show timeseries data, or if you just have multiple sets of numbers you need to show on different axes. We'll begin by creating an XY chart. I'll head over to the Perspective Component Palette. And under the Chart category, we'll grab XY, drag that onto our view. Now we can see there's already a trend on here. This is just being populate by an initial data set. So just sample data. If we take a look at the Property Editor here, under data sources there's this thing called example, and if I expand that, we see the various elements. If I keep drilling in we can see that I have three items right now. So there's a timestamp, which is currently being shown on the x axis. And then process_temp and output_temp, which are being shown on the y axis. So the work flow for the XY chart is that you bring your data in as a data source, you configure your axes and then you define a series of data. The series of data just specifies which data source, which axes, and which column. Now we can have multiple data sources. You can have separate data sources listed here, and show the pens from the various data sources on the chart. But let's start by populating this with our own data. So instead of adding a new data source, I'm simply going to replace the data inside of example here. I'll do that with a binding, I'll press the binding icon for example. I'll select tag history as the binding type. If you need more information on this type of binding, please check out the Tag History Binding video. And to keep the example clean, I think I'm just going to show the last 10 minutes of data. But I don't want to forget to add my tag path here. So let's hit the little tag button. I'll go to my Tags folder, and I have some tags, some Sine tags here, that I'm collecting historical data for with the tag history system, so I'll just select the Sine0. Again, please see the tag history videos for more information about configuring your tags for tag history. We'll hit okay here and technically we're ready to go. I have a dataset that has some content that's being brought in; however, I am going to change the value format here to document. The main reason why I'm doing this is a little bit of a convenience thing later on. It doesn't really matter what you set the value mode here to, in both cases we can use the data that this binding's bringing back on the XY chart. However, if I set this to document, I can actually examine each row. So we'll set value format to document, I'll hit okay, we can see that example now has 100 rows inside of it, and it's showing the sine0 data, as well as a timestamp associated with it. Now, the larger problem though, is that's not really much of a trend. So we've brought the data in, but we haven't told the chart what it should do with sine0. To do that, let's collapse our data sources here. And again we have all these properties, we'll kind of scroll down a bit more, there is a series property. Each element under series is a separate pin you want to show on the chart. So if I look at element zero here, we'll expand it, and we'll scroll down a little bit further. We can see that we have the name for the pin here, which is being represented on the chart in a couple locations. But the data, the data property here, if I expand that, these settings here dictate where the data for this pin's coming from. So again it's looking at the example data source. So if I created a new data source at the start here, I'd have to change the name here to match the name of the new data source. And then for the y axis here, we need to specify a column within that data source. Now we didn't really make any changes, our column is just sine0, so, sine0. And there's our trend. So again, multi-step process. You need to provide some data to the chart, and then tell the chart what to do with it. Now if I needed to add more pens or more series elements here, we know that we can always add a new array element under series, the schema for the series is already defined, so it'll auto populate with what properties you need to define. However, instead of typing everything out, I'm going to right click on series zero here, I'll copy, and then I'll right click on series two, I'll paste, that way I can just change the name as well as the data, so that it looks at a different column in my data source.

                                    In this lesson, we'll take a look at the Perspective Time Series Chart Component. Designed for working with time-based data on the x- axis. To get us started, I have a flex container in my view here, and I'm just going to open up my component palette and drag in a Time Series Charts. Then I'll go into the property editor and just set the time series chart's grow value to one. So it takes up all available space. Now in my tag browser on the left hand side, I have some historized Sine tags which are just following simple wave forms. But let's go ahead and walk through pulling that into our new chart. In my property editor, the series property controls what data is actually displayed in the chart. So currently in my sample data here there's a single series with the name of boiler and then a data array. That data array can have multiple keys in it so if I expand data and then zero, we will see that our series currently has temperature and pressure pens, which are being displayed on my chart. There's also a time value which the chart is automatically set up to use as the x-axis. So I'm going to rename my series to sineData. And then for the actual data prop here I'll click the chain link icon to configure a tag history binding on the components. So on that tag history binding I'll change the point count to something like 500 to pull in 500 data points and I'll just leave the time range alone. So I'll get to see the last hour of data in here on my charts. So now that I have the range, I want to pull in some pens. So on the right hand side I'll find the tag icon and I'll just pull in a couple of pens by selecting the tag and clicking OK. So how about just sine zero and sine one? And once I have that I'm done with the whole minding, so I'll click Ok. And just like that, we'll get some good data coming into our charts. Now I'd like to note that the tag history binding is pulling in a data set to fill in the data, and that's just fine. If we use a data set to pull things in, each column in the data set will be its own pen. And the first column will be treated as the time column, which happens to be correct as is. So with that done, let's take a look at how we can customize our chart a bit more. Now I want a time to get to every property in this example but as always, our user manual is a great guide on all the properties that this component has to offer. With that said, let's go ahead and find our plots property down below. The plots array will contain an element for each subplot in our chart which is basically a different set of pens and axes. And inside of that array element, we actually have a chance to configure those pens and axes. So in total, most of the configuration for our chart will happen in this plot's array. Inside my plot I have trends, which is an array containing an element for each data series I'd like to show on my chart. So I'll start by creating a trend, and then inside of that trend I'll set the series to sine data. Now, I was already getting data on my chart, but coming into the trends section here, allows me to do things like change the type say, create a bar chart or an area chart or set up an axis in the axes array down below then specify it for the series. And if I find that axes array and add an element to it, we can see that creating an access is as simple as specifying a name, minimum, and maximum as well as specifying some formatting options for the access labels and tick marks. Going back into my trends, I can also use the columns array here to choose a specific subset of the pens in my data to show. So if I wanted to just do sine zero or sine one. I can also use that array to change the colors and properties of the pens directly but I'll be taking a different approach to that in just a moment. Finally, at the bottom here we have baselines which allow us to add calculated pens like an average, or a UCL or LCL value based on some other pen. So if I collapse the plots array I do have an opportunity here to configure some other settings, like a title for my chart or how I'd like the time access to look along the bottom or the time range displayed even below that. We also have an x-trace section. So if I go into preview mode and hover over the charts we can see what our pin values are at a specific point. So I can use the x-trace section to control how that feature behaves. I can also select specific pens to highlight them and make them easier to see as well as zoom in and out using my mouse's scroll wheel. And if I zoom in I can also pan around just by clicking and dragging. So a couple more properties here on the right hand side I have a legend, which I could turn on to get a sense of which pens are which, and I can change the position of the legend to be on any of the four sides of the chart. And finally, the last set of properties on my chart concern color schemes. So if I don't want to take responsibility for coloring each of my pens myself, we can use a color scheme here to define some default colors. And there are many different schemes to choose from. Whichever scheme you pick will be subject to different requirements based on the current pen state meaning whether it's been selected or a different pen has been selected and so on. So that about wraps up our discussion of the Time Series Chart, it's a great way of visualizing time oriented data in perspective.

                                    In this lesson, we'll be taking a look at the chart range selector component, which allows us to show a miniature chart that we can use to select a date range from a main chart like a time series chart. So to get us started I have a time series chart here, already configured to show me historical data on a Sine pen. The one thing missing is a way to change what time range I'm seeing data for. So for that let's go ahead and drag in a chart range selector. And once I've done that, let's dive into some of the properties. On the right hand side you'll see a data property, which is expecting all of the chart data we'll be using, just like any other chart component would. It's an array of objects where each object includes values for all pens, as well as a special time value which will be the x-axis. So to make this work, I want my chart range selector to show the same data as the time series chart up above. So what I'm going to do is select my time series chart, find the series property and expand the first series. Then find the data property inside, which is bound to a tag history binding and right click then say copy binding. That'll take the tag history binding I've configured on my charts and copy it to my clipboard. From there I can select the chart range selector, find the data property, right click and say paste binding. And with that our two charts have the same data on them. Most of the other properties on the chart range selector are pretty similar to properties on a time series chart. We can specify things like how our x and y axis should look as well as what color scheme we'd like to use for our pens. Now on my range selector, I can test out making a selection, by going into preview mode and making a selection by dragging. Then I can move that selection around by dragging again or resizing the selection interval, or zooming in and panning just like I can on a time series chart. For the rest of this example, we'll take a look at how to make our time series chart respect the selection. What I need to do is come out of preview mode, then select my time series chart, and I'm going to go back into my series and find that tag history binding. Now if we look at the binding, we'll see that we're getting all data for the past hour. But I want the range to come from the selector. So I'm going to change the time range on the binding to historical and then lengthy start and end dates to the selector. So I'm going to find the little FX icon on the start date, clear out the contents, then use the property icon to find the chart range selector, expand props, expand selected range and click that start prop, then click okay. Then I'll do the same thing for the end dates just clicking through, until I find the end prop. And once everything is hooked up I'll click okay. And that's it. Now if I go into preview mode, we can see that sliding around our chart range selector will update what we see on our charts.

**[00:00]** [00:00]
                                    In this lesson we're going to discuss the Power Chart, a charting component in the perspective module designed to work with tag history data that does a multitude of built in features and customization options. We will be devoting a few videos to these components, in this one we'll be focusing on the basics of using the component and configuring a few basic options. To get started, I've got a flex container here and I'll find my way into the component palette and drag over a Power Chart component. Then I'll go into the position properties and set the grow value to one, just so that it takes up all available space in my view here. Now on the left-hand side in my tag browser I have a handful of Sine tags, which I've set up tag history for already. And if I want to show them on my Power Chart the process is pretty simple. I'm just going to put my designer in preview mode, and then I'm going to click the Tag icon in the top left corner of the chart select through into my historical tag provider and then pick which tags I'd like to see.

**[01:06]** [01:06]
                                    I can Control + Click to select multiple. So how about I just select the first three here, and then when I'm done I'll click Add Selected Tags at the bottom and just like that we have some tag data in our chart. So now that we have some tag pens let's talk about some of our charts special features. I'll begin by collapsing my little side panel here using the icon in the top right. Now, our chart area is divided into a few different sections in the main area we have our actual chart data with a time axis along the bottom and a y-axis showing actual values. Below the chart we have a little table showing some aggregate data for different pens things like the Current Value on the pen, the Minimum Value in our charts, the average value and so on. We can also hover over different pens in that section to manage the pen or remove it from our charts. And across the top we have several different configuration options for the chart, from the left, we have that handy button we've used earlier to add more pens to the chart, and next to that we have a time range selector for the chart.

**[02:05]** [02:05]
                                    If I click on that section, it opens up a little selector that allows us to show a time range like the last 30 minutes or eight hours or two days or a historical range which allows us to choose any two dates we want as the start and end date for the chart. Now, as we consider this setting and other configuration settings it's important to keep in mind that so far I've been working entirely in preview mode here. So this is all exactly how you'd see it as a user in a real perspective session. One of the key features of the Power Chart is that the vast majority of the available chart properties are built into the component interface. For instance this time selector we've just seen is basically just controlling some underlying time properties which we can find in the config property at the top specifically. The other configuration options we'll look at here are similarly tied to properties behind the scenes. Occasionally you will find some properties like the mode settings we're about to get into that have some extra options in the property editor but we've tried where possible to give the user total control over how their chart is configured right from the session.

**[03:08]** [03:08]
                                    The other thing to note about this setup is that, however my chart looks in the designer is how it I'll look by default in a real session. So adding in pens, configuring a time range and so on, will actually affect what the user sees initially when they open up this view. So with that said, let's take a look at some of the other icons on our chart here. The first little grouping of four icons on the right-hand side is for controlling the chart mode, so to speak. The chart mode effectively determines how the user can interact with the main chart area. The first chart mode, which is the default is Pen and Zoom, which allows the user to zoom into the chart, using the scroll wheel on their mouse and then drag side to side to view different portions of the time range clicking the Expand icon in the top right restores the original range. If I select the second mode that one is called X Trace, which allows the user to hover over the chart, to see x values at the time associated with the mouse cursor's position.

**[04:04]** [04:04]
                                    If I click the mouse, it'll actually leave an X Trace marker at the specified location, and I can place multiple markers, if I'd like. To remove the markers I click the little More icon with three dots on the right-hand side, which has a clear X Traces option. Next step, we have Range Brush which allows us to revisit our table running along the bottom. As we've established that table is showing us aggregate data for the chart, but while I'm in Range Brush mode I can drag across specific chart ranges like so and see the same aggregate data for just that time range. I can resize that brush or drag it around, and I can even create additional brushes by dragging across a separate time range. If I want to get rid of a range, I just click the Trash can icon next to it table. So let's just clear out our brushes. Finally, the very last mode is Annotation mode. This mode allows us to make notes that are attached to individual data points on our chart, so for instance, I can click on a point here and say, "My note," and then hit Save, that'll save the annotation to the tag history tables in the database, specifically the annotations table.

**[05:16]** [05:16]
                                    So that annotation will be shown to anyone who pulls up this tag history data. And on a final note, I can hover over the annotation to modify or delete it. Now, besides the Chart modes, there are some other properties along the top here, one is Full screen, which will hide the table and icons from the chart and allow the chart to take up a little bit more space. Next to that is the Settings icon which will allow us to dive a bit deeper into our chart content configuring Tag, Pens, Axes, and Subplots. We'll leave this section alone for a later video, but I will note that the columns tab here allows us to customize what is displayed in the Pen table across the bottom as well as what is shown when we create one or more range brushes in Range Brush mode. So the very last icon here is this More icon which just allows us to export the chart data as a CSV file or print the chart to a printer or a PDF file.

**[06:07]** [06:07]
                                    This wraps up our basic discussion of the Power Chart components. It's a great way to chart history data across the perspective platform.

**[00:00]** [00:00]
                                    In this lesson, we're going to be taking a look at a specific setup for a power chart, one in which the tag pens the chart is pointing at are tied to some kind of parameter. In short, we refer to this concept as an indirect power chart, meaning a power chart that is using indirection to pull different tag pens into the chart. Now, to get us going I've done a little bit of work already. I've created a machine data type and currently I have four instances in my tag browser here. Each instance has a temperature and a pressure tag. Now, I've taken some other steps, as well. I've created a dropdown component that I've nested in a flex container across the top of my view here and that dropdown just allows the user to select a specific machine, which will end up on the value property of the dropdown. So, if I go into preview mode and select machine two, for instance, then come out of preview mode and select the dropdown, we'll see that the string machine two ends up on that property. Now, one final bit of preparation I've done, I've pulled the temperature and pressure pens for machine one onto our chart, just to give us some sample pens to work with.

**[01:10]** [01:10]
                                    These pens aren't currently tied to the dropdown in any way. If we'd like to configure indirection on the chart, we can drill down into the chart properties, specifically pens here, and then the first element, and then data, and then that source property is what controls what tag path we're looking at. So, to get our path to be indirect, we can just buy into that source property. So, I'll copy out the current source using Control C, and then click that chain link icon to pull up the binding interface and select an expression binding. And once I'm in there, I'll just paste in that path, put the whole thing in quotes to make it a string, and for those part, this is the right string to use here. We just need one piece of it to be dynamic. So, I'll put a break in the string right where it says machine one, and use that space to pull in a property. And in there, we'll just find our flex container and then our dropdown, and then pull that value property in.

**[02:09]** [02:09]
                                    Then I'll just link up the different parts of my final string using plus signs, and that's it. I can see from my preview that my expression is working, so I'll go ahead and click okay here. Now, I just want to do the same thing on the other pen. So I'll right click on that source property, say copy binding, and then open up my second pen here, go into the data property, right click on the source property there, and say paste binding. Now, I just need to go in and change the temperature tag reference to a pressure tag reference. And that's it! That's all we need to do to make our chart indirect. So, if I select a different machine in my dropdown, like so, it'll update the tags being shown on the chart. Just as one final note, it's possible to take an entirely different approach here. If we bind on the plots array property instead of the individual tag objects, we could use a script transform to populate the entire pen structure, which would allow us to make our solution a little more robust.

**[03:08]** [03:08]
                                    For instance, if each machine had a dynamic number of tags that we might want in our chart, we could use that script transform to pull them in. Whichever approach you take, it's not too tricky to set up a power chart that looks at dynamic sets of tags based on a parameter.

                                    In this lesson, we're going to be focusing on how we can modify a few lower level configurations on our PowerChart. Specifically pens, axes, and plots. Like most of the PowerChart's properties, the user has the direct ability to manage these aspects of the chart configuration from the session. So to get started, I have a PowerChart here that I've made a few configurations on already. I've got two pens on the chart, temperature and pressure, and I'm just showing recent history on them. That said, there are a few things we could stand to improve. For one, our tags are showing values with two pretty different units. So it doesn't make much sense to show them in the same place. Also that the values could fall in pretty different numeric ranges. So we might end up with two pens that are pretty hard to see if they get far enough away from each other on a graph. So let's do something about it. The first thing I'd like to do is move my pressure pen to a separate subplot, to break it out from our other pen. To do that, I'll start by going into preview mode. And then I'll find these settings icon, the little gear icon in the top right corner and click that.

**[01:07]** [01:07]
                                    And then I'll navigate to the plots tab. And then I'll click add plot. From there I have access to a couple of different properties for our new plot. The first is this relative weight field, which indicates how much vertical space each plot is going to take up. It'll be evaluated relative to the sizes of the other plots where higher numbers get more space. The other property here is a background color for the plot, which we will just leave at white. We also have an Add Marker option here, which allows us to draw horizontal lines or ranges on the plot. I'll just leave that alone for now and click the add button at the bottom of the display. Now let's just say for fun that we want our first plot to be three times the size of our second plot. So I'll click the pencil icon on that first plot, change the relative weight to three, and then click done at the bottom. Now that we've configured our plots, let's set up our pens to actually use them.

**[02:03]** [02:03]
                                    So we'll navigate to the pens tab. Find that pressure tag and click the pencil icon to change the tags configuration. You can also get into this menu from the table underneath the chart, by hovering over a pen. Now, all I need to do in this interface is find the plot field here and change the value to Plot 1. But let's talk about some of the other features here too. Specifically, we have some properties for controlling with the pen appears on the chart above, but we can also fine tune how we want the pen to appear. For instance, we can control the type of our pen, setting it to something like bar will effectively change the chart type from a line chart to a bar chart. Scatter will avoid drawing lines at all and just plot the points. Now different pen types here will also affect what other properties we see below. In this scatter type for instance, we get to specify the radius of each dots, as well as what we want the colors to be under different conditions, whether the pen has been selected or highlighted and so on. If I change the type back to line, we get to specify how the line should be drawn between points and how we want our line to look.

**[03:08]** [03:08]
                                    We can even make it a dashed line by specifying a non-zero stroke dash value here. At the very bottom, we can change what tag path we're looking at as well as what historical aggregation mode we're using to process our data. I'll just leave all that alone and click done at the bottom here. And right away, we'll see our second plot come up. Finally, let's also work on our axes a bit. Now I've taken the liberty of setting up an axis already, which is why both of our plots now say temperature data, instead of say pressure data. So let's fix that for our second plot. I'll navigate to my axes tab and click Add Axis. And from there, I'll specify that label setting for the pressure value. So I'll find access label here and say pressure data. Now some of the other settings include how wide I'd like my axes to be and how I want that label to look. I just happen to know that I set my other access label to a 14 point font.

**[04:02]** [04:02]
                                    So I'll set that here as well. I can also change some colors here, like the colors of my tick marks and the color of that label we just made. If I want to customize the range for the chart, I can uncheck auto range here and type in some numbers, but I'll leave it alone to save my changes. I'll just click add here. The last thing I need to do with my access is configure my pressure pen to actually use it. So I'll find a way back into the pens tab, click the pencil icon next to that pressure pen, change the axis two axis one, and then click done at the bottom. I do want to note that all of the settings we looked at here are also available from the property editor directly and the way we've been configuring things here is also available in the session. There is one hidden property here that's not available in the session though, which is this time access configuration over here. We can change the tick marks and access color of our x-axis from there. So that does it for our coverage of the power charts, pen access and plot properties. We're providing a built-in way here of configuring exactly how your pens should look from the designer or even from the session.

                                    One of the most fundamental building blocks of a perspective project is a view. A collection of resources bundled in a root container that can be used in a few different ways throughout our project, as a primary view, a dock view, or a pop-up view. In this lesson, we'll explore another key use for views, which is as a form of, well, a perspective template. Views in perspective can be nested inside each other, which is perfect for content that needs to be repeated, swiped through, or even spun up dynamically. Creating so-called template views can also serve as a good way to avoid duplication of effort, either within a project or throughout several. If I have 10 motors, maybe I don't need to create 10 different views, I could just create one view that works for any motor. So let's just walk through a simple example. Let's consider this view I have here, which is set up to show some sign data in my system, specifically from my tags on the left-hand side here. I've already got a nice time series chart across the top that's showing me tag history data for my first signed pen, but underneath it, I'd like to provide just the current value for the pen directly.

**[01:03]** [01:03]
                                    Now I could just add components in here to show that data point, but say I'd like to use the same display in other places in my project as well or in different projects entirely. For that, let's go ahead and roll up all of our components into a standalone view instead. So to get started, I'm going to find the views folder in the project browser, right click and select new view. Let's set up a view called sign value and let's make it have a route container type of flex. And I'll make sure to leave the page URL checkbox unchecked because that would give this view its own page and I don't really want that. Its main purpose is to be nested inside other views. So with those settings in, we'll click create view and get to designing our view. To get in the spirit of creating a nested view here I'll make my view a little smaller like so. Now I'd like to show two things inside this view a label that says sign one on the left-hand side and devalue on the right-hand side. So to do that in the top right here I'm going to set my direction on my flex container to row, then we can get to adding our components.

**[02:05]** [02:05]
                                    In my component palette I'll click and drag in a label component and then I'll also drag in an LED display component. I'll begin by configuring my label, so I'll select that, then set the grow value to one. So it takes up all remaining space in the view, I'll also set the text property on the label to sign one. Since we're going to be showing data for just the sign one tag in here. And then for added flare let's go ahead and configure some styling on the label. So next to where it says style I'm going to click the little paint swatch icon to configure an inline style. So maybe I'll expand text and set the font size to 16 points and set the text alignment underneath to center and then I'll click okay at the bottom to finish and I think that looks pretty good for now. The final thing I'd like to do in my view is time I already display to an actual value. So I'll click on the LED display, then click the chain link icon next to value. From in here, I'll configure a tag binding and then on the right hand side I'll select the tag icon, expand tags, expand sign tags and then select sign one and I'll click OK.

**[03:12]** [03:12]
                                    Now I'm done with the binding so I'll click OK here as well and that's it. I now have that sign value coming through on my LED display. It's now that our view is configured, let's work on how we can incorporate this view into our project. So I'll navigate back into my sign data view. Now there are two ways I can incorporate that new sign value view we just worked on. The first way is to go into our component palette and search for the embedded view components, then I'll just drag that component into my view here. The embedded view component allows us to show any other view inside of this one and to set it up all I need to do is with the component selected, I'll find the path property in the property editor expand the dropdown and select assign value and that will make my sign value view show up. There are some other properties here. We have a Params field that we'll talk about in a later video, and we have used default view width and used default view height. These are going to control whether we use the size of the view as we configured it inside the view or whether we expand or contract the view to match the size of the embedded view components.

                                    So I do want to briefly mention there's a slightly more convenient way of adding embedded view components. We can just find the view we'd like to embed in the project browser, click and drag that into my view. And that just adds an embedded view component that's looking at my sign value view already. It's also worth noting that other components also make use of embedded views in one form or another. The carousel components, flex repeater, view canvas and accordion component all are built to work directly with nested views while other components like the table and mat components can work with embedded views in certain configurations. So that wraps up the basics behind nesting views and perspective. In later lessons We'll talk about other features that help us work with views of it better.

                                    In this lesson, we'll be exploring a critical feature behind nesting views in Perspective, which is parameter passing. Parameters come into play when we want the nested view to be dynamic in some way, or we want the outer view to respond to changes that are made inside the nested view. They can also come into play on some specialized components, like the table and dashboard components in specific situations. To walk through an example of parameter passing, I have some sine data set up here just pointing to the sine tags that I have in my tag browser. I have a chart at the top and I have a drop down that I'm using to change which sine tag I'm seeing data for. Now, one of the things I have underneath here is a nested view that's just showing data for sine zero. And for this lesson, I'd like to make that view show me data for the sine tag I have selected in the drop down. So to do that, I'm going to need to pass a parameter into that embedded view. To get started, I'll open up that view, which is called sine value, from my project browser. And then when it comes up, I'm going to find a particular section in the property editor, this params section in the bottom right.

**[01:05]** [01:05]
                                    In a way, any properties we can figure in this section will be shared both inside and outside the view. So in my case, if I want to show data for a dynamic sine pen, I'm going to want my components to look at a different tag based on that parameter. There are a few different ways to do this, but simplest might be to use tag name here as a parameter. And for the value field on here, I can set a default value, meaning a value if the view isn't passed to parameter when it's embedded, so something like sine zero here would do just fine. To the right of our parameter configuration is a little arrow icon, which is very important when working with parameters. This, generally speaking, controls where the parameter can be controlled from and where it's value is meant only to be viewed. In its current configuration, we've declared tag name as an input parameter, meaning that we're expecting the value to come from outside the view and used inside. This has a few different ramifications. For instance, clicking the chain link icon here will bring up an error message indicating that we can not configure bindings on input parameters. 
[02:06]

**[03:09]** [03:09]
                                    So now that we have our parameters, our only remaining job is to link everything up appropriately. Let's start by incorporating that tag name parameter to make things dynamic in here. And for that, we'll have a few bindings inside here that we need to set up, one on the label and one on the LED display, to make these fields dynamic, based on that parameter. Let's start with the label. So I'll go ahead and select that label on the left-hand side and find the chain link icon next to text in order to make the text dynamic. And this will just be a simple property binding and I'll bind this back to view, params, tag name, just pulling the parameters value right onto this label, and then I'll click okay. Next is the LED display. So I'll select that, and then we actually already have a binding set up here. It just happens to only be pointing at sine zero. So I'll need to make a dynamic tag binding, or in other words, an indirect tag binding. So I'll go in and find my tag binding, and here I can just change the radio button to indirect. That'll actually copy over the path from the direct tag binding, which is just a path to the sine zero tag.

**[04:11]** [04:11]
                                    If I needed to make this binding from scratch, I would just pull this path in from the tag icon on the right-hand side. But since I don't, I'll proceed by removing the part of this path that needs to be dynamic, and then I'll use the property icon with my cursor right in that spot to pull in view, params, tag name again. And so with that path set up as dynamic, our parameter can control the tag this component is pointing at for its value. So now that I'm done, I'll click okay. Finally, I want to pull the value of my toggle switch onto my is active output parameter. To do this I'm going to set up a binding on the parameter itself. So I'll need to start by selecting the view in the project browser, then finding that params section again, and clicking that chain link icon next to is active, and then this will be a property binding. So I use the property icon on the right to find view, root, toggle switch, props, selective. And I'll pull that in and click okay at the bottom.

**[05:10]** [05:10]
                                    So now that we have our parameters set up and our view is set up to use them, we just need to go out to the instance of this view in my sine data view. Here we still have a job to do, which is to take the value off of our drop down and pass that into the view on that parameter. And so here, we're still seeing data for sine zero, but it's just because the default value on the parameter is set up to show sine zero. To get our view working here, I'll select it and then find the params section here. Inside this object we'll see the is active parameter set up already because of the binding we configured inside the view. But we'll need to configure another parameter for the other field. So I'll click the plus icon and select a type of value. And then it's very important that the name matches up exactly here, otherwise we won't be catching the right parameter on the other end. So my name should be tag name. And then I'll conclude by pulling the value of this parameter from my drop down. So I'll be clicking the chain link icon here and selecting a property binding, and then using the property icon on the right-hand side to pull in view, root, drop down, props, value.

**[06:17]** [06:17]
                                    So now whatever the user selects will be pulled up. And then as a fun surprise, I've set up a label in my view that will become visible when that toggle switch is set to true. And it's already hooked up correctly, so if I select the label, which is invisible, we can go into the visible binding and see what I've set up in there. It's basically just a property reference wrapped in an expression that will prevent it from throwing confusing errors if the parameter doesn't exist. So I'll click okay and test it out. If I go into preview mode here and select, say, sine four in the dropdown, we can see that we get sine four's data showing in the nested view. We'll also see that if I flip the toggle switch inside the view, the little label I've set up outside the view responds to that change. So, that concludes our basic coverage of view parameters. They're a convenient way of passing data into and out of a view, depending on your needs.

**[00:00]** [00:00]
                                    In the course of working with views as templates, it's often useful to design a view specifically for a UDT. Say I had a motor UDT and I had 100 instances of that UDT I was working with. It would be very inconvenient if I needed to design 100 different views, much simple areas to design a single view that accepts parameters to determine which motor to show data for. In this lesson, we'll be looking at how we can create a template view that takes a UDT instance as a parameter and uses it to populate components inside. So instead of motors, I have tanks, which you can see in my tag browser here. Each tank consists of a fill level, a status, and then a name for the tank. I've taken the liberty of designing a view that will accommodate the structure, which we can see here. We're working with a label that will show the tank name, a cylindrical tank that will show the fill level and a multi-state button that will show the status and allow the user to control it. So before we get started on the view, we'll need to configure parameters to get these three pieces of information.

**[01:03]** [01:03]
                                    So I'll select the view in the project browser, and then I'll find the params section in the bottom right and click add view parameter. For this our view parameter is going to be of object type. We're effectively going to get an object that contains a value for each tag in our UDT. And I'll give my parameter a name of tank UDT. There's an easy way to populate this object with every value we'll need, which is just to set up a temporary binding directly on the parameter. I'll start by changing the direction of the little arrow to bi-directional. This will allow us to configure a binding on the parameter, but it'll also be useful in a moment in allowing us to update our status field inside our view. Next, I'll be clicking the chain link icon here, and we'll add a tag binding with a type of direct, click on my little tag icon and just point it at one of our UDT instances for a moment. So I'll go into my tanks folder, select tank 1, click okay and then click okay here to finish up.

**[02:04]** [02:04]
                                    And we'll see that we get those three values coming through. Now I don't actually need this binding. It was just to get those values set up, so it could be chain link icon again, select remove binding, and then click okay. So now we have the three fields we need and we're ready to configure bindings inside our view. So let's start with this label here. I'll select the label and we'll bind the text through to the tank name. So chain link, icon, property binding, and then I'll use the property icon, view, params, tank UDT, name, and I'll click through to commit the binding. Next step we have our cylindrical tank. So I'll select that and we'll bind the value on this one, property binding again, property icon, view, params, tank UDT, fill, and I'll click through again. Finally, we have the multi-state button here, which is a bit more complicated. I've already taken the step of binding the indicator value to the control value here. So I just need to bind through on that control value. So chain link icon, property binding, property icon, view, params, tank UDT, status, click okay.

**[03:14]** [03:14]
                                    And then the one extra thing I want to do here is make this binding bi-directional because if the user changes the status on the button, I want that to get written back to the status tag. So with that done I'll click okay. And that actually completes our view. The important thing here is that that parameter is set to bi-directional. So when the status inside the view changes, it can get written back out. So now we're ready to nest our view somewhere else. I have a view prepared in a tab at the bottom here, and I've already set up an embedded view component inside that view, pointing at the view we just made. The one thing I need to do is bind through the parameter. So I'll find the params property here and select add object member, and then go inside that object and add another object. I'll call it tank UDT. Remember that parameter name has to line up exactly for our setup to work. There is no need to populate that parameter here. I'm just going to click the chain link icon and select a tag binding type of direct. Although any tag binding type would do if our setup called for it and bind through to my favorite tag UDT instance.

**[04:15]** [04:15]
                                    So maybe take seven and then I want to make this binding bi-directional so that the status changes can get back to the tag and that's it. So once we have that checkbox checked, we can click okay. And any tag members will get passed through inside the view automatically. So if I go into preview mode, we can see the changes I make to the status propagate back through to the tag. One final thing I'd like to demonstrate here is that it's actually possible to drag and drop UDT instances to create our view. For this will need to do a little bit of pre-configuration on the view itself. So I'll find that again, in the tabs at the bottom, and then with the view itself selected in the project browser, you want to find the drop conflict property in here, and that should have two sub properties UDTs and data types. It looks for this interface more in a later video, but for now I'd like to expand UDTs and select add array elements. That'll add a new object. And inside of that object, we have three fields; type, param and action. In the type field I select what UDT I'd like to tie my view to.

**[05:16]** [05:16]
                                    So I'll expand the drop-down here, go into tags, data types and select my tank type. That'll link the UDT to this template view when the UDT is dropped into another view, now that the link is established, we just have to specify where the UDT data will go inside the view. So I set my param field here to tank UDT, which is the name of the parameter we've created. Finally, there are two action types, bind and path. Bind will pass through the UDT instance on a tag binding like we've seen already, so we'll leave it at that and that's it. So now we can find our way back into the tanks view here. And then in the tag browser, I can find my favorite UDT instance, drag that into the view, select the tank template, and that'll create an instance of the tank template view that's already tied through to the dragged instance.

**[00:00]** [00:00]
                                    Within Perspective, we have the ability to drag and drop a tag onto a view to create components that are automatically hooked into the drop to tag. So for example, if I find my integer tag here, I can drag into my little test view here, like, so and then I can choose a component, let's say a cylindrical tank, and then we'll get a cylindrical tank component that's already bound through to my integer tag. Now this is a great little shortcut for adding components into Perspective, but there's a little bit more to it. In addition to creating components via this drag and drop method, we can also create view instances. In this lesson, we'll explore a few different ways we can drag and drop tags to create embedded view instances rather than just components. So the first step to configuring this is to find the embedded view I'd like to use as a target. I already have one in mind. I'm just going to find the fill level view in my project browser here and open it up. Now, the way this view works, is it takes a fill level as a parameter, and it just fills out a label and cylindrical tank component with that fill level.

**[01:07]** [01:07]
                                    Now everything inside the view is hooked up already. So if I set the parameter value here to say 50, the components update to match. What I need to do from here is provide a way of linking that fill level parameter to a tag that's being dropped. For that, I'm going to find this drop config section in the view properties, inside of there, we'll find two options UDTs and data types. And for now I just want to link to an integer tag. So I'll expand data types and click add array elements. Once that element is added, we'll find an object with three nested properties. The first is type, which refers to the tag data type. We can use any tag data type we want, in this configuration, we'll be able to add instances of this view whatever an integer tag is dropped in which is just how I want it. The next field on here is a parameter. So when my editor tag is dragged in, what view parameters should receive the value from that tag. Here, I just need to specify my fill parameter. So I'll type in fill, and then the final field on here is interesting. We're given an action choice and our choices are bind and path.

**[02:08]** [02:08]
                                    This actually dictates what gets passed into my fill parameter. We can either configure a tag binding on the tag drop which would pull the value from the tag onto my fill parameter, that's the binding choice here, or we can just pull any path to the drops tag which would allow us to do something fancier like an indirect tag binding to a specific tag property. I'm happy leaving this as is on that bind option. So with that done, we can find our way back into my test view here and then we can test out our drop configuration. So I'll take my integer tag again, drag that in and this time at the bottom of the list here we'll get an option to create our fill level view. And when I select that, we'll get our view. If I select the embedded view here, we'll see our field parameter listed but they chain link icon next to it which is that tag binding that was auto-generated because we selected the bind option for the drop action. Now that we've seen a way to link views through from standard tags. Let's also look at a way to link to user-defined types. In my tag browser, I have this tank's folder which contains many instances of a tank data type I created.

**[03:10]** [03:10]
                                    And in my project browser, I have a tank template I created to show values for this UDT specifically. So I'll go ahead and open that up. One brief note here, we did work with this view in a previous video and we've already done an example of a drop configuration to a UDT using a tag binding as the action. So to see that specifically, check out the UDTs and template views video. Here, I've configured my view to accept a tag path to a UDT instance. So currently it's working with a default value of default tanks tank one. We just have indirect tagged bindings inside the view tying all of the fields to different member tags in the UDT. So if I click on my cylindrical tank for example and go into the value binding, we can see that it's just the tag path parameter followed by a specific tag name to reference. Closing out of that, I'll find my way back onto the view itself in the project browser. And now we can configure a way to create instances of this view whenever my tank UDT is dropped. So if I drop config here again, expand UDTs this time, add an array element.

**[04:12]** [04:12]
                                    And the only difference here is that the type we specify is a user-defined type rather than the standard type, the other fields are the same. So for the type I'll expand the dropdown then expand the tags data types and then select the tank data type. Then for params, I'll type in tank path which is just the name of my parameter here. And then for the action, I'll select path. So this time we'll be pulling through the tag path to the UDT instance onto that parameter. And that's it. So now if I find my way back into the test view I can find a tank in the tanks folder or the tag browser drag that in and then select the tank template view, and then we're good. So that wraps up our discussion with drop configurations for views. They are a great development shortcut when you're working with views you want to link to tags.

**[00:00]** [00:00]
                                    In this lesson, I'll demonstrate how to pass a tag path to a perspective view to dynamically display live tag values. This can be done with any kind of tag, but on my gateway, I have some UDTs in my tag provider that represent different stations with tags that I want to visualize in a pop-up view. I want to use this one view and have it dynamically display my tank level tags for the station I choose to display. I'm going to copy and paste the tag paths of tank one for stations one and two to demonstrate how similar these are in my tag structure. You can see that they're almost identical except for the station number. If I pass the beginning of my tag path up to the specific UDT, I can use that to dynamically build a tag path with a hard coded string for the rest of the path. I'll show you what this looks like in a minute. The first thing I need to do to make this dynamic is to add a parameter to my pop-up view. I'll make sure to select the view itself as opposed to the root container, and then I'll find the parameters section of the property editor and click add view parameter.

**[01:03]** [01:03]
                                    I'll name this "tagPath", and then I wanna make sure that this arrow is facing to the left as this makes sure that this is an input parameter, or in other words, this value is expected to be set from somewhere outside of the view. I'm gonna copy the first part of the tag paths we looked at earlier, and I'll copy up to station one and paste it into this parameter. This will let me test out the rest of the view as I build my tag bindings. Next, I'll add the tag bindings to the vessel values. So I'll start with tank one. This is a tag binding and I want it to be an indirect binding, so I'll click that radio button and then to help build this out, I'll click the tag icon to select an example tag as my starting point. So I'll drill into station one, tank one, and then level. If I check out the binding preview at the bottom of the page, I see that this will end up displaying a value of 52, which is what I want. However, I want to use the tagPath parameter that I just created, which already contains the first part of this tag path up to tank one. So I'm going to delete this first part and then click the property icon to insert a reference into the path.

**[02:04]** [02:04]
                                    The param is on this view in the params folder, and then it's tagPath here, so I'll click okay. This ends up showing me the value of 52 again, which is good, so I know the tag path was built correctly. However, this should now be dynamic and display tank one levels for other stations, depending on what ends up being passed to the view parameter. So I should be able to go back to the view parameters and update this parameter. If I change the tag path to point to station two, I end up seeing the level for tank one in station two. I'll set up a binding for tank two as well. This will be the same steps, so I'll make it an indirect tag binding, pick a tank two level tag, and then substitute the first portion with the tag path param. Now the pop-up view is ready to dynamically display tank one and two levels, depending on the tag path that's passed to it. The last step is to add some way to pass the parameters to the view.

**[03:03]** [03:03]
                                    I'm gonna do this with a couple buttons. For the first button, I'm gonna right click and go to configure events. Then I'm gonna choose the onActionPerformed event and add a popup action. My view is called "Popup", and I'm gonna click the plus icon here to add a parameter. Any available parameters should show up, so I'll go ahead and click tagPath. And then for the value, I'm gonna paste the same string that I manually entered into the param to test earlier. Then I'll click okay. For the next button, I'll replicate the same exact steps, except this time I'm gonna pass the tag path for station two, and then I'll click okay. Now I'll make sure to save, and then I can launch a session and test my work. I'll click the button on the left to pass the station one tag path to the popup view, and I can see the tank levels for station one.

**[04:02]** [04:02]
                                    Then I'll close the popup and click the other button to pass the station two tag path. And now I can see the values for station two. I can also update the tag from the tag browser to confirm its polling live values. To summarize, I created a view param on my popup. I referenced that parameter in the indirect tag bindings on my components, and then passed a value to the parameter when I open the view. Now I have a single popup view that dynamically displays live values based on the information that's passed to it in the runtime.
