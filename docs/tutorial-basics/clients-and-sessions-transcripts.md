                                    Launching a Vision Client is done using the Vision Client Launcher. You can download and install the Vision Client Launcher from your Gateway Homepage. You'll notice that I'm currently here on the Gateway Homepage, and in the bottom left corner here, I can download the Vision Client Launcher. I'll go ahead and click on that button, and it's gonna take me to a new screen, where it is going to automatically detect my operating system. I can click on the download button, in the upper right-hand side to download the Client Launcher for my detected operating system. Or I can click on one of the download options on the right, for different operating systems. I'll go ahead and click on the download for windows button, to download the Client Launcher Installer and then I'm gonna run that application. I'll go ahead and install it just for me.

**[01:05]** [01:05]
                                    And then we're greeted with an Install Wizard. Here we can choose where we want to install the Vision Client Launcher, I'll just leave it at the default and hit next. We can also choose to create a desktop shortcut, which I will and hit next. And now we're ready to install by clicking the install button. You'll see the Vision Client Launcher installs very quickly. And once it's finished, we are ready to click the finish button, which will automatically open up our Vision Client Launcher. When you first open the Vision Client Launcher, it may automatically find your Gateway for you, like it has here for me. Clicking yes will allow you to add Vision Clients from that Gateway, to launch from this launcher. I'll go ahead and click no for now, and take a look at the launcher itself. I can add a client from any Gateway, that the launcher can see on the network.

**[02:05]** [02:05]
                                    To do so, I simply need to click on the add application button here. And the launcher will automatically go out on the network, and find all available Gateways. If for some reason, the Gateway is not showing up in this list of available gateways, I can also manually type in the gateway URL, to find clients that way. Once I have selected my gateway, I then want to hit the select Gateway button in the lower right. It will then go into the Gateway and get a list of all of the available clients. These are all of the projects in the Gateway, that have a launch able Vision Client. I simply need to select the clients that I want to be able to launch, and then hit the add applications button in the bottom Right. You'll notice that they get added, to my Vision Client Launcher. If you click on the menu button of any client, and go to manage, it will provide you with some configuration options for the client.

**[03:09]** [03:09]
                                    Here I can set things like the Fallback Application or the Window Mode, or even go to the Client Tag Overrides tab, where I can specify specific overrides to happen when I launched this client. Finally, in the upper right hand corner of the Vision Client Launcher, is the settings button. Clicking this, takes us to the settings of the Vision Client Launch as a whole. These settings are similar to the Designer Launcher, in that you can set up a default application, that you want to launch, when you first open the Vision Client Launcher, and you can tell the launcher to automatically exit when you launch a client. You can also export and import the Launcher and application configurations, using the buttons down below.

                                    In this video we're going to take a look at the different launch modes for a client in the Vision Client Launcher. Within the Vision Client Launcher, it is possible to manage a client by clicking on the menu button at the top right corner of a client and going to manage. Here we can edit some properties about the client, but most notable is the window mode property. The window mode property will allow us to choose how we want our client to open, either as a window or as a full screen client. I'll leave it at window and hit okay, and then I'll go ahead and select the client and select the open application button at the bottom right to open it up so we can see what it looks like. Here we can see our windowed client has now opened up. It does start out maximized, but because it is a window, it does have a bar up at the top that allows us to resize our client to be any size we want on the screen.

**[01:15]** [01:15]
                                    I'm going to close my client now and try switching it over to the full screen mode. I hit okay and I'll open the application once more. Here we can see that the client is in full screen mode. There is no longer a bar up at the top that allows me to move my client around or resize it. As such, there is an X in the upper right-hand corner that allows you to exit the application. The exit button can be disabled by opening up this project in a designer and going to the project properties.

**[02:03]** [02:03]
                                    Finally, I also wanted to mention that there is a default launch mode property in the project properties. This allows you to specify what the default launch mode of the client is, so when I add the client to my Vision Client Launcher, I can determine whether I want it to start at full screen or windowed mode by default.

                                    In this lesson, we're going to take a look at how we can hide the menu bar within the client. The command menu is actually part of a project template and is put together in a client event menu bar script. We will go over managing that script in a later lesson. However, it is also possible to hide the windows menu, which shows a list of all currently open windows, as well as the menu bar as a whole. To do so, we need to go into our designer and open up our project properties and go to vision user interface. You'll notice there are two checkboxes here, one to hide the menu bar and one to hide the windows menu. Now, if I select to hide the windows menu and hit OK, I will need to save my project to get the changes to take effect in my client. And if I look at my client, you'll notice now the Windows menu is gone from my menu bar. Let me go back to my designer and into my project properties and this time I'll choose to hide the entire menu bar. I'll save my project, and once again, I'll go back into the vision client and you'll notice that the menu bar is still there. If the client is already open, the menu bar will not go away even through a save. You need to log out of the client and then log back in for the change to take effect. So I'll go ahead and log out of my client and then log back in and you'll notice now the menu bar is no longer there.

                                    In this video, we are going to take a look at the new authentication option for Vision clients. Normally, when you would open up a Vision client, you would log in using a user from a user source. Let's remind ourselves what that looks like. I'll go into my tools menu and launch my project. Let me pull it over onto this screen and we're greeted with the normal username password log in where we would type in our credentials and it would log us into the project. However, with Ignition version 8.1, there is now a new way to log into clients, and that is to use an identity provider. To have the Vision client use the identity provider on log in, we will need to go to the project properties. If we navigate to the Vision log in section, you'll notice at the top there is an authentication strategy and it is currently set to classic. Classic will use a user source for authentication. But I can change this to be identity provider, which will use an identity provider for authentication within a Vision client instead. I'll go ahead and hit okay, save my project, and launch it again. Pull it over onto this screen again, and now you can see we're no longer asked for a username and password. Instead, we're given a login button which will take us to our web browser where we can log in using an identity provider. You can see here that a new tab in my web browser opened up and it has allowed me to log in using my identity provider. Once I've logged in, it lets me know I'm good to go and I can close this browser tab and my Vision client will already be logged in.

                                    In this lesson, we'll take a look at opening additional desktops. Creating a new desktop gives some additional workspace for vision windows. You can see that I have a client open here as well as a bunch of buttons on this one window. Desktops are open with a Python script and I have several ready on these buttons here. If I click on the open single desktop button here, another desktop appears. Obviously I can reposition it, I can also resize it if I like, or even move it to a completely different monitor. Now, while I can make those changes manually, I can actually automate them on the button press. So say I wanted to open a desktop down here on the lower left corner of this monitor. I've got a separate button for that, and here's a different desktop.

**[01:03]** [01:03]
                                    I can also create a new desktop with multiple windows open. So if I click this button here, there's another desktop that has a docked window as well as a main window inside of it. Additionally, one desktop may make navigational changes to another desktop. So I could close this docked window here from my primary desktop on this single button press here. And once I'm done, I can close all of these additional desktops. So let's take a look at how I'm doing this. I'm going to bring up my designer. I'm not going to show you the scripts on all of the buttons here as they will get fairly redundant, but let's take a look at the multiple windows desktop I created. So I'm gonna open the script on the button and we can see I'm doing this by calling system.gui.open desktop here. I'm specifying which monitor the desktop should open on as well as which window should appear inside of this desktop.

**[02:04]** [02:04]
                                    I gave it a handle which is a reference I can use from other scripts later on. I then specified the position as well as how large the desktop should be. So this is how I opened the desktop with multiple windows. Let's take a look at that button that closes just one of the windows. I'm going to close this scripting window here, and I'm gonna open up the scripting window on the close docked window button. You can see I'm calling this system .nav.desktop which just gets a reference to some desktop that's open. And here's where I pass in my handle. That handle comes in handy if you plan on having desktops interact with each other. So it's a good idea to give your desktops meaningful handles. Once I have a reference to that desktop, then I can tell her to go ahead and close this one specific window. Now, if you're looking for information on all of these scripting functions, check out the multi-monitor clients page in the user manual or the scripting appendix.

**[03:07]** [03:07]
                                    Now say I wanted to pass a value from one desktop to another desktop. The easiest way to do this is actually with a client tag, while desktops appear as separate windows, they're all part of the same client instance. This means they share client tag values. So for example, I have this another window over here. This is one of the windows I'm opening on those additional desktops. It has a numeric text field component and it's bound to this my client tag here. So I'm going to go back to that desktop window and I'm just going to drag and drop this tag onto the window to create a numeric text field. That way, we can see the value from any one of these windows. I'm going to save my changes. My client's configured to automatically update, so the new component is ready.

**[04:04]** [04:04]
                                    I'm gonna open that multiple windows desktop, and if I change the value on this numeric text field here, it changes the value over there as well. So again, it's really easy to pass values between multiple desktops. Now, in this video I've been using buttons to open the new desktops, but if you want the desktops to open automatically when the user logs in, then we can instead use a client startup script. Back in the designer under project client events scripts, here's the start-up event. This way the desktops will open in the positions you want without making the user manually open and configure them.

                                    In this lesson, I'll demonstrate how to configure the minimum client size for a Vision project. I currently have a client open, and if I drag and resize the window, you'll notice that the components will move around and resize along with the window. However, there's a certain point where that stops happening and scroll bars will appear. This is because I've reached the minimum client size. To show how to configure this, I'll swap over to my designer. This setting is found in the project properties, so I'll open up that window real quick. Then under the Vision section of properties, I'll click User Interface and it can be found right here. There's actually two properties here for the minimum width and height, and you can see that they're currently set to 800 and 600 respectively. That means that the scroll bars appeared once I resize my vision window to be below 800 by 600. I'll change these both to zero and we'll test the behavior in the client. I'll quickly save the project and then I'll head over to my client and now when I drag and resize components will continue to shrink and I won't see any scroll bars.

**[01:08]** [01:08]
                                    There is one exception to this and it has to do with docked windows. Once resizing, the window cuts into the docked window, scroll bars will still appear to preserve the size of the docked window. You can see that this starts to happen with my north docked window. If I cut into the height of it. Aside from that exception, the main point is that shrinking a client window below that client minimum size causes scroll bars to appear. It's a good idea to plan for what you expect the minimum client size to be based on the screens that will be viewing your project and design your project around that.

**[00:00]** [00:00]
                                    There are two different ways for a vision client to receive updates once changes have been made to its project. The first way is via an update notification. The idea is that I can make a change to my project here in my designer. Let's say I want to add a chart component to my main window by dragging one over from my component pallet like so. If I want my vision client to update and show this chart component on my main window here, I have to first save my project. Now, I will bring up my vision client. Here, we are greeted by the same main window as in my designer. But you will note that the chart is missing. This is because although I saved my project, my vision client has not been updated. You may have noticed at the very top of my client, there is a small orange banner that tells us that there are available updates for this project.

**[01:06]** [01:06]
                                    If I click on the banner, a small window will appear where I am asked to confirm if I really want to update my client. I will press the update button, which will cause my vision client to reinitialize. And now, I see the chart that we added earlier. What if I wanted my project updates to be automatically pushed to the client? We can actually change the way client updates are handled in the designer through the project properties. So let's get back to the designer. From here, I can head over to the project menu, project properties, and under vision general, I will find the update mode setting. We have already seen the notified mode. So I will select the push mode and press okay. For this change to fully take effect, I actually have to save my project first so that it knows to use the push update mode.

**[02:05]** [02:05]
                                    Any change I make after that, like add another chart to my window, saving my project will cause this new change to automatically be pushed to the vision client. So if I were to bring my vision client back up, you will find that new chart on our window without us having to manually update the client. Now when a client updates, it actually closes all of its open windows and then reopens them again. Meaning that a client update could potentially disrupt your vision client during important operation times. This is why picking the right update mode for your project it's important. You can manually update your vision client using the notify update mode, or you can have your vision client receive project updates automatically using the push update mode.

                                    In this lesson, we will learn about the project polling base rate. Ignition vision projects allow you to configure a project wide polling rate for any database related bindings that are configured to use it. Here are my designer, I have a power table, which has a SQL query binding configured on its data property. This binding is configured to use the project's polling base rate, which is by default, 5,000 milliseconds or five seconds. This means that every five seconds, my binding will reevaluate and poll the database for updated data. Let's look into this tables data binding and its configuration. With my table selected, I will head down to the property editor and find its data property. I will click on the chain link icon next to it to see its binding configuration. You will note that it is configured to use the relative polling mode.

**[01:05]** [01:05]
                                    This tells this binding to pull at the project's polling base rate, of again, five seconds. If I wanted to, I could give this binding its own custom rate by selecting the absolute polling mode. This will allow me to configure the polling rate within the binding itself. Finally, I can use the spinner to add or subtract seconds from the polling base rate as well. Now, you can configure a project's polling based rate from the designer by going to the project menu, project properties, when the project properties window appears, we can head over to the vision timing section, where we will find the polling base rate setting, which can be set to literally anything you want. Just like that, you can either have your database related bindings follow a global polling rate by using this polling base rate setting, or you can configure a custom polling rate within the binding configuration itself.

                                    In this lesson, we will explore the touchscreen capabilities of an Ignition Vision project. There are a few project settings associated with this touchscreen feature, so let's explore them now. From my Designer, I'll head over to my Project menu and select Project Properties. This will cause my Project Properties window to appear. From here, I'll head over to Vision General, where I will find the touchscreen mode enabled setting. Touchscreen mode should be enabled on all Vision projects by default. Once touchscreen mode is enabled, you can activate touchscreen mode via scripting, or you can have touchscreen mode become activated on Client start-up by using this setting right here. To test this functionality, all I will do is press OK. Save my changes.

**[01:03]** [01:03]
                                    And then I will use the F10 shortcut key to open up my Vision Client. Once my Vision Client opens, if I click on my username text field, I will be greeted by a touchscreen keyboard. I can now use this touchscreen keyboard to put in my username. Similarly, I can use it to type in my password. Notice the protected characters for my password. I'll press Enter, and then press Login. That same touchscreen keyboard that I used earlier is also available for me to use from anywhere in the Vision Client. To demonstrate this, I'm gonna press this button here to open up a pop-up window, which contains both a text field and a numeric text field. Just like before, selecting the text field, I am greeted by my touchscreen keyboard, so I can type pretty much anything I want.

**[02:10]** [02:10]
                                    If I select my numeric text field, I am greeted by a numeric keypad that I can also use for numeric input. Just like that. By having touchscreen mode enabled and activating on start-up, Ignition will automatically show a touchscreen keyboard or numeric keypad to accept input from a touchscreen device. This functionality makes Ignition Vision Clients very flexible and usable on almost any type of device.

                                    In this lesson, we will learn about the different ways you can customize your Vision project's login screen. Here in front of me, I have my default login screen for one of the projects in my gateway. On the upper left-hand corner, you will first notice a logo followed by a title of my project, which is just my project's name. You will also see text reels for both the username and password with their own labels. And you will also see a login button with a login text. Let's head over to our Designer so that we can explore some settings that will allow us to modify this login screen. I'm going to close the Client. And from my Designer, I'm gonna first head over to my project properties. I'll do that by heading over to the Project menu, Project Properties. And under Vision Login, we will see all the different settings that will allow me to customize my login screen.

**[01:09]** [01:09]
                                    First, I'm gonna put a welcome message for my application. So I'll just paste this right here. I also want to give my application a new welcome image. So I'm gonna use this button here and I'm gonna select one of the images in my gateway. For my username text, I'm gonna say, Input your username. I'll do the same for my password text. And for my login button text, I'm gonna say something like, Press to login. Now for my locale selector, I'm gonna tell it to actually show the locale selector. What this does is, it allows you to select between user defined locales or languages for your Vision application.

**[02:06]** [02:06]
                                    Once I'm done configuring my login screen, I can press OK. I can save my changes. And I can launch a Vision Client by using the F10 shortcut key. Once my Vision Client launches, you will notice on the upper left-hand corner my custom logo that I selected. You will also see my welcome message. And you'll actually notice that it respects the HTML code we pasted in there earlier. You will also see the custom labels for both password and username text fields. You will also see my locale selector to select the language for my Vision application. And finally, you will also notice the custom text on my login button. Just like that. By playing with a few projects settings, we can modify the look of the default login screen for your Vision applications.

                                    A Perspective Session is launched within the web browser, meaning it simply opens up as another tab or window in your web browser. You can launch Perspective Sessions from your Gateway Homepage, which we're currently looking at right now. In the middle of the page, on the right-hand side, you'll notice a View Projects button where we can view all of our projects that have Perspective elements in them. To launch a Perspective Session, we simply need to click on the Launch Project button underneath the session that we want to launch. You'll notice my Perspective Session launched as a new tab within my web browser. I can simply switch back and forth between the two tabs to see my Gateway and the Project that I've just launched. You'll also notice that I didn't have to login to the project. By default, Perspective Sessions don't require that you log in to view the contents of the project. However, you can customize security and require a login if it's needed. Finally, because my Perspective Session is just another page in the web browser, you'll notice that it has its own URL. We can actually use this URL to launch a session without even having to go to the Gateway webpage. I'm going to go ahead and enter in my other project's name here, in this case, Test, and you'll notice I launch my test project as well. This eliminates the need to go to the Gateway to launch a Perspective Session. You simply need to know the URL of the project you're trying to launch. We recommend bookmarking the projects that you want to launch often.

                                    The Ignition Perspective app is a mobile application that can be downloaded and installed on any modern iOS or Android operating system. You'll notice that I have an emulated Android device here, and I've already downloaded and installed the Ignition Perspective app on this device. You can find the Ignition Perspective app on your local app store such as the Google Play Store for Android or the App Store for iOS. While a Perspective application can be launched from a mobile device's web browser, the Ignition Perspective app allows us to utilize the tools that the mobile device has available such as the accelerometer, the camera, or any geolocation data. I'm going to open up the app by clicking on it, and it takes us into the application where we can see a list of all of our potential Perspective projects that we can launch. Here we can see that I can actually launch two different Perspective projects from two entirely separate gateways. This first one here is the online demo project which I can launch from the Ignition. 8.0 Demo Server Gateway. The other is a project called test, which I can launch from the Inductive_University Gateway. To add additional Perspective projects that we can launch within the app, we simply need to click the plus button down in the lower right-hand corner. We are then presented with two options. We can either scan a QR code that may have the information that we need to navigate to a Perspective project, or we can do a gateway search where we will search on the network for an available gateway that has Perspective projects on it. Clicking on Gateway Search also allows me to select from gateways that I've used previously or manually input a gateway hostname and port if it doesn't find it automatically. Back on the main screen, we can also filter the list of projects that we see in this list by clicking on the magnifying glass up at the top to filter the list of applications. This allows us to find the project that we want to launch a little bit easier if we have a large list of projects. The Ignition Perspective app also has some settings that we can configure by clicking on the gear icon in the upper right-hand corner of the screen. Here you can do things like organize the list of gateways or automatically launch a project when you open up the Ignition Perspective app. Let's go ahead and launch one of our Perspective projects now. I'm going to go back to the main screen and to launch a project, I simply need to select it from the list. I'm going to click on the Online Demo to launch this Perspective application. Here we see our Perspective application in our mobile device. Just like within the web browser, The applications launch within the mobile device are mobile responsive, so if I change the orientation of my device, the application will automatically adjust with my new configuration. As I mentioned earlier, because it's a native application that's running within the mobile device, it does have access to extra features that the mobile device has available such as a camera, accelerometer and a geolocation.

                                    In this lesson, we'll take a look at Perspective session update notifications. When working in the Designer and making a change to a View, as soon as you save the Designer, it pushes those changes up to the gateway and then the gateway immediately distributes them to any open sessions. So your users don't manually have to update their sessions to see these changes. To demonstrate, when I'm in the Designer here, you can see that I have a View and on this view I have a Label. Let's get a session open, so I'll go to Tools, Launch Perspective and Launch Session, and the View you're seeing in the background here has already been configured on the root page for this project here, so you can see it already in my browser. Now, let's make a change. So I'm going to grab the Label that's in the Designer here, and I'm just going to move this down a bit. Now I'll also move my Designer down, just so you can see what happens here. We'll save our project, hit save again, and you can see that the Label moved. So if I move my Designer out of the way, the text is down there now. And again, I didn't really have to do anything in the session, it just automatically updated. Now in some cases, you may want to push out a notification letting your users know that there is an update coming. This is useful in applications where you have any sort of data entry from your users. It gives them a chance to basically wrap up their work, before the updates come. You can turn these on back in the designer. If you go over to Project Properties, and under the Perspective section there's a general area, and this top check box at the top turns on those update notifications. I'll enable this, and you can see that there's some text, which I can make changes to and modify if I want. This is the text that's going to appear in the notification. Now you can see that there's this little "time left" inside of curly brackets here. That basically represents the current timeout period. So it lets the user know how much time they have until the update happens automatically. So if the user doesn't respond, we'll still update automatically, the users don't have to do anything. Now in the interests of time, I'm going to reduce the timeout here to five seconds. So let's hit OK and you're going to notice this immediately. So if I again move my Designer out of the way, if I hit save, and save again, you can see that they get a little project update area, and there's also a timer that's counting down, until the session gets updated. Now that was kinda boring, let's actually make a change. Let's go to our Component Palette and under the Display category, I'll just grab a Cylindrical Tank. Let's place that on the View somewhere, and let's try that again. So we'll save, we'll save again, we get our banner and you notice that there is actually an "Update Now" I can just click on. So either when the timeout period expires or I click Update Now, the tank's suddenly appeared. So again, the default behavior for your sessions is to automatically push out any changes anyone makes when you hit save, but of course you can always opt in to these notifications.
