                                    In this lesson, we will do a review of  the Ignition software and its capabilities. We will cover some of the features that make Ignition unique and  a leading development platform in the world of HMI and  SCADA Design. Ignition is a software platform for creating custom HMI,  SCADA, MES, database applications  and more. The Ignition software is web-based and is installed  and deployed using web technologies. The Ignition Platform is managed controlled and configured  using a fast, easy to use web interface. Finally Ignition developed applications and its designer  tool are launched using web pages. The web-based nature of Ignition makes a versatile  and safely accessible across a network. Now that we have covered the basics of what Ignition is what  can it do exactly? Using web-based communication Technologies, Ignition can  access PLCs, OPC servers, as well  as connect to SQL databases on any platform.

**[01:08]** [01:08]
                                    This capability paired with Ignition's visualization tools  allow users to create powerful and responsive  HMI and SCADA applications to monitor  control and historize information about their  industrial processes. Ignition's robust historian system allows for  high performance data logging and data visualization. With just a few clicks Ignition makes it possible  to begin data logging to an ample list of SQL database flavors. The historian also takes advantage of data compression algorithms  reducing the impact on storage hardware  and data transmission time. Ignition's reporting engine allows users to  create Dynamic PDF reports Ignition reports make SQL data visually stations second  nature with the use of charts tables images  and more. If you want to print email or save daily  reports Ignition's reporting engine is the  tool for the job.

**[02:06]** [02:06]
                                    Ignition's ability to connect to databases coupled with  its strong visualization tools means you  can build database applications with ease. You can create POS, CRM, and even inventory tracking  systems. Connecting to other databases in  your plant floor and other database driven applications has  never been easier. Ignition's state of the art alarming system can be  used to send out notifications via voice, SMS, and  email. Ignition's modular architecture allows you to mix and  match all of these features in any way you want giving you  the flexibility to tailor your Ignition gateway to suit your  specific needs. What makes Ignition so special? Ignition is sold by the server license and you can add unlimited number  of clients, screens, tags, connections,  and devices. An Ignition installation is completed in under three minutes  making its deployment fast and easy.

**[03:04]** [03:04]
                                    Ignition is a fully cross-platform software and it can  work with Windows, Mac OS, and Linux servers. Ignition's core functionality and its various  modules allow it to function as a communication hub. Ignition  has a built-in OPC UA server with  drivers to connect to a wide variety of PLCs Ignition  can also connect to third-party OPC DA and  OPC UA servers allowing you  to connect to practically any PLC that exists in the market. Ignition also supports the MQTT communication protocol  and can connect to an MQTT broker for  fast efficient data access. Ignition can connect to any web service. Typically ERP  systems. Ignition can also talk to  any SQL database whether that be MySQL,  Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, Postgres,  DB2 and more. Ignition can also interact with other MES and  ERP systems.

**[04:02]** [04:02]
                                    It can also connect to a LIMs devices such as barcode scanners,  scales sensors, and special laboratory  equipment that companies use. Ignition projects can be launched from mobile devices or touchscreen  panels anywhere and can also be launched from  any PC regardless of the operating system. Ignition has four main parts: the Gateway,  designer, clients, and sessions. The Gateway is the primary service that controls your Ignition server. It is a single application that runs an embedded web  server that allows you to connect to data, install modules, and  communicate with clients and sessions. The designer is a web launched application that lets  you configure and build Ignition projects. The designer  is launched from the designer launcher, which can be  obtained from the gateway's web interface. Clients are the runtimes of the Vision module. They run  as full applications and feel like traditionally installed  clients without the need to install and manually synchronize  your projects.

**[05:04]** [05:04]
                                    Clients are launched from the Vision Client Launcher that can  also be obtained from the gateways web page. Sessions are the runtimes of the Perspective module. They are similar  to the Vision Clients, except they run in a web browser. Sessions are launched from the Gateway web page as well. The Ignition Gateway being a web server can be accessed from  any web browser that is visible to the Ignition Gateway over  a network. Everything from your Ignition projects, tags, OPC  connections, database connections, images, all  live in your Ignition Gateway. If you wanted to connect to a modbus PLC on  your plant floor, the device creation will be configured in the  Gateway. similarly if you wanted to connect to an  external database the connection would also be created through the  gateway's web interface. As we explained earlier Ignition is installed as server  software and it is web-based. So you can access your  Ignition Gateway anywhere in your network by using any web  browser.

**[06:01]** [06:01]
                                    The basic flow of Ignition is to first get access to  the designer through the Ignition gateway's web interface. The designer is launched using the designer launcher, which  will be downloaded onto your machine from the Gateway. With a designer launched you can now create your very  own Ignition projects. Once you configure your project you simply save your  changes in your designer and the project is sent back  to your Ignition server or Gateway. You can configure HMI and SCADA screens, the  historian, alarms, recipe management, reporting,  KPI monitoring, database applications,  and more. Once the project is saved on the server, it's available to launch  as a runtime application for our client. You can open a runtime application as easily as opening the designer  using the Vision Client Launcher for Vision developed  applications and the Perspective Session Launcher  for Perspective developed applications. There is no limit on how many Vision Clients or Perspective Sessions  you can launch.

**[07:02]** [07:02]
                                    So the basic flow here is to open the designer from the Gateway configure  your project save your changes and open  a runtime. A major benefit of Ignition being server base is that  you can make a change to the project in the designer. The changes  automatically sent to the Gateway which then updates all of  your running client applications instantaneously. You don't  have to worry about restoring a backup of your projects on  all of your gateway machines. Ignition is a powerful software platform for creating  custom HMI, SCADA, MES, database  applications and more. Its various modules give it the configurability and  versatility to adapt to almost any application? Its ability to communicate with plcs, databases, OPC  servers, MQTT brokers, web  services, etc,  make Ignition's data access  reach almost infinite. Future courses in Inductive University will dive  deeper into Ignition its uses and functionality.

                                    Ignition is a modular platform, meaning that you can add additional modules or applications to Ignition in order to extend its functionality. You can pick and choose which modules you want to add to the software, depending on what functionality you need. Just like you can pick and choose which applications you want to add to your smartphone. As you can see from the list below, we offer a wide range of modules with each module providing different functionality. There are visualization modules like vision or perspective that enable you to rapidly develop industrial applications for your site. And again, you have a choice in which module suits your needs. If you're trying to build mobile first projects and applications optimized for web browsers, then perspective would be the way to go. Alternatively, if you're designing traditional plant floor displays, hmis, and desktop screens, then vision might be the better choice. And of course, if you needed both visualization modules, there's no limitation here.

**[01:03]** [01:03]
                                    You could build projects in both vision and perspective without issue. Taking a look at the rest of our module categories, we have modules for data and logic. The SQL Bridge and Tag Historian modules allow you to historize tag data into your database. Logical systems can be created inside Ignition with sequential function charts, or you can program against the web server inside the ignition gateway, with web development. We have various notification modules which allow you to notify users when alarms happen within your facility, either through email, SMS or phone call. Finally, we have enterprise wide and connectivity modules. Here you have access to different OPC servers. You have the ability to control many installations of ignition from one location with enterprise administration connections to MongoDB and the addition of system serial functions to Python scripts. Most of these modules here would be considered core modules with each encapsulating a core SCADA or HMI principle, and they are developed in house by Inductive Automation.

**[02:06]** [02:06]
                                    Now, I didn't cover all of them in depth in this video, however, I have linked the modules page of the Ignition user manual below for more information. Of course, these modules don't make up all that ignition has to offer. We can see here where modules sit in the ignition software stack. You'll notice the modules sit on top of the platform extending the platform's original functionality with new features depending on what modules you install. The core modules are all developed in house by Inductive Automation, but there are also modules that are not developed by inductive automation that can be added to your software as well. These modules can be developed by one of our third party partners or one of the various other module developers. These third party modules can further extend Ignitions functionality outside of our core modules or platform functions. And if what you're looking for isn't available, you can create something custom for yourself or help make ignition better, by creating your own modules. With the many different modules to choose from, it's easy to create a software solution to fit your facilities needs.

                                    Every company can use the Ignition software in unique ways depending on the needs of their facility. Companies can even have multiple facilities each with their own unique needs for the software. How the Ignition Gateway or gateways are set up in a facility is what we like to call the Ignition system architecture. The architecture gives us an idea of where Ignition sits within a facility's infrastructure as well as how it communicates with various things throughout the plant such as PLCs, databases, and even the clients. What's important to understand is that there are not correct architectures and incorrect architectures, and you certainly don't have to follow any of these examples we have here. These examples can be thought of more as a guide to help you plan out what you need to do within your facility. To start, one of the simplest architectures that we can think of is what we call the standard architecture, which you can see in the image here. Typically, you would have an Ignition server sitting somewhere within the facility communicating with one or more databases and also communicating with one or more PLCs. It can then relay this data to any number of clients running throughout the facility. This simple architecture is where most users start when they first install Ignition at their facility. Of course, there are variations on this such as adding redundancy or placing the Ignition server and/or database server within a cloud-based environment. As your Ignition use grows, you may find that you need to adopt a new architecture to fit your facility's growing needs. With growing systems, we typically see two types of growth. The first is a growth in density of data and operations at the facility. While Ignition may be unlimited, we typically find that users run into a limitation of the hardware as their facility grows. This is what we call a scaled-out architecture where the load on the Ignition system has been scaled out over multiple Ignition gateways instead of pushing all the data through one central system. You'll notice that as the number of devices in the facility grew, we split the Ignition system into a front-end gateway and multiple back-end or tag and I/O gateways. The tag and I/O gateways communicate solely with the devices and can then push this data to the front-end gateway which supplies it to the clients. This has the benefit of spreading the communications load out to multiple points in the network instead of having everything communicate through one location. It should also be noted that as you scale out even more, the cost doesn't increase dramatically. Because the back-end gateways are only used for communicating with various devices, they don't need any visualization system modules like Vision or Perspective but simply need the device driver modules. Similarly, because the front-end gateway is only concerned with the visualization systems, you would have those types of modules on that gateway, but you wouldn't need things like the device drivers. Of course, you can add variation to this architecture as well. Here you can see we have multiple front-end gateways behind a load balancer so that as new clients come online, the load balancer automatically distributes the load amongst all of the front-end gateways. The other common type of growth that we see is a growth of geography where there may be multiple facilities spread out over a wide geography. Typically, with these types of architectures, you would want a central Ignition gateway which helps to manage all of the other facilities' gateways and facilitate communications between all of them. You'll then notice that each site has an installation to fit its needs. The remote site SCADA on the left and local site SCADA on the right have architectures very similar to a standard architecture. The local devices facility has something similar to a back-end or tag and I/O gateway that's pulling the tag data from the devices and passing it on to the central Ignition gateway. And then the remote field devices have either an Edge gateway or MQTT-enabled devices placed next to them, and those push data back to the central Ignition gateway as well. With every site sharing data back to the central Ignition gateway, you now have the ability to compare all of the data between all of your different sites. One thing to keep in mind is that even with this larger and more complex architecture, you can still plan out an individual site's architecture as well, scaling out that site as needed.

**[00:00]** [00:00]
                                    Installing Ignition on a Windows operating system is pretty straightforward. You just need to download the installer file from the downloads page of our website inductiveautomation.com and then run that file. I already have the downloaded installer executable here so I'm just going to double click on it to run and then the installer process is going to begin. We're greeted with the Ignition installer, clicking the next button allows us to walk through the installation process.

**[00:32]** [00:32]
                                    This section allows us to specify an installation directory as well as a gateway service name, I'm going to leave these settings at their defaults and then click next. We can then choose if we want to do a typical installation or a custom installation. A custom installation is going to allow us to choose which modules we want to install while a typical installation will install a standard set of the most common modules. Note that the modules you install could be subject to licensing or addition constraints so if you're planning on installing Ignition Edge or Maker editions, there's not much point in installing modules that aren't supported.

**[01:03]** [01:03]
                                    That said, I'll stick with the typical option and then click next. Now that we've made all of our selections, we're ready to begin the installation. So I can click the install button and we'll get the install process started. You'll notice the installation process is very quick, it'll usually take less than three minutes. Additionally, you may have noticed that we didn't have to install Java first before we ran the installer. As of Ignition 8, Java comes prepackaged with the Ignition installation. So we don't need to install or manage it separately. So we can see that the Installer has finished running and we're ready to start the Ignition service. So I'm going to click on the finish button which will go ahead and start Ignition.

**[01:40]** [01:40]
                                    Now when you install Ignition 8 for the first time, your web browser is going to open up to a page like this. This welcome page takes us through a process known as commissioning. Commissioning allows us to set up our gateway for the first time including selecting which edition we'd like to use and setting up ports and login info for our gateway. First we have to select which Ignition edition we'd like to use on our gateway. So we can choose between the standard Ignition platform, Ignition Maker Edition or Ignition Edge. I'll just go ahead and select Ignition. Next we have the end-user License Agreement. You can go ahead and read through that and when you've done that you can click on the radio button next to I have read and agree with the terms and conditions then click the next button to proceed. This next page allows us to create our first user account which will be used for logging into the gateway web page and designer at least initially.

**[02:28]** [02:28]
                                    So maybe I'll give my user a user name of Ignition next we need to provide a password so we recommend entering in a strong password since these credentials are used for access to the gateway's most sensitive areas. The password strength meter on the right lets me know that I've typed in a strong password so I'm going to go ahead and click on the blue next icon down at the bottom right. This last page allows us to configure which ports the Ignition gateway should run on. The default HTTP port is 8088 and the default HTTPS port is 8043 but we can change them here if we wanted to.

**[03:00]** [03:00]
                                    I'm going to leave those at the defaults and click on the blue finish setup button in the bottom right hand corner. Now that we finished setting up things for the first time we're ready to click the start gateway button. So I'm going to go ahead and click on that and the Ignition gateway service is going to finish starting up. One useful note, the user profile and port settings we've configured can always be changed at a later time in later videos we'll take a look at how we can make those changes. When the Ignition service finishes starting up, we're greeted with the Gateway home page where we're ready to navigate over to the config tab and start setting up connections or open up our designer and start building our application.

**[00:00]** [00:00]
                                    In this lesson, we'll look at upgrading Ignition. I have Ignition installed here on my local system, and I would like to upgrade to a newer version. Before we do anything with the upgrade process, we generally recommend you go to the Config section of your Gateway, go to Backup/Restore, and take a Gateway backup with the big blue button here. If you're unfamiliar with what that is, that's basically a copy of your entire Gateway, all of your projects, all of your configurations, saved into one file.

**[00:35]** [00:35]
                                    The upgrade process for our Gateway is incredibly simplistic and is rarely error prone at all, but it's always a good idea to just take a Gateway backup just in case something does go awry. Okay, so now that I have a copy of my system here, the next thing we need to do is we need to figure out our licensing situation, so if you have a license applied, you'll want to make sure that your license allows for upgrades. So if you've purchased a license for Edge or standard Ignition, then you may want to reach out to your account rep to make sure your license is capable of upgrading, which is only ever an issue on major and platform version upgrades, so say you're upgrading from Ignition 7.9 to Ignition 8.1, now this generally isn't the case if you're upgrading minor versions, so if I go to the status section here, and on the overview page here, we can see that I am currently running 8.0.13 and I'm going to upgrade to 8.0.14.

**[01:27]** [01:27]
                                    So if it's only the last number that changes there, that's a minor upgrade. Generally doesn't have any sort of licensing restrictions. Now if you're trying to upgrade a Maker Edition Gateway, then no worries at all since you can easily generate any new license if you even need to. All right, so we got the licensing stuff out of the way. I'm going to switch tabs here. And on our main website, specifically if you go to our downloads page, which may or may not look different depending on when you view this video, I'm going to scroll on down here, and I'm looking at the installers for 8.0.14, which again, is the version I'm trying to upgrade to. You do have some options depending on your various operating systems here. Now I'm going to show you how to use the installer to upgrade, since that's really the easiest and generally the preferable approach, but we do have a generic zip, which you can use to upgrade if you prefer. If you're going to take the zip route, there is a README file that's in there. That will tell you what to do. So I'd recommend you'd follow the steps inside of there. Now we do have right now these Edge zip files here.

**[02:23]** [02:23]
                                    These were sort of a dedicated way to install Edge, but the generic zip as well as the installer, I'm going to show you here, can all upgrade Edge, Maker, and standard edition Gateway, so you don't necessarily need this last option here if you're going to go the zip route. You can take the generic zip. All right, so I'll save you the trouble of watching me download this. If I head over to my desktop, I do have an installer ready to go. Now, upgrading with the installer is more or less the same process as just installing Ignition with the installer. So really, you just need to be able to run it. So I'm going to show you how to do this on Windows, but once you get to the point where you're running the installer, the process basically becomes the same for all of the operating systems. The only thing I will say about different operating systems is that on Linux, make sure the installer can run as a program. So there's some permissions you have to change on the file to get that to run. For more information, take a look at the installing on Linux lesson or take a look at the installing content in the user manual. But I don't need to do that right now, so I'm going to go ahead and right click, and I will run this installer here as an administrator.

**[03:26]** [03:26]
                                    Now, let me move the install wizard over into view here, and it basically starts off as the same path as just installing on a fresh system. I'll hit next here, and my current Ignition installation is installed at this path here. So when I try to go to the next step, the install wizard's going to detect that Ignition's installed there and it's going to say, "Oh, hey, do you want to upgrade instead?" Which I do, so I'm going to press the yes button here. And it's going to switch over to the module selection area and this more or less looks like what the custom installation type looks like. The one thing I do want to call out is the additional modules tab here. Now our installers, and this is true for the zip files as well, have some of our modules, but they don't have any third-party modules inside of them. So when you're upgrading, the installers will try to upgrade your modules, but there will be some cases where the installer doesn't have some of the third-party modules you downloaded. So at this point, it's basically asking you what do you want to do? So, I have an MQTT recorder module on my Gateway here, which isn't included in our wizard. So by default, it does set it to keep as is, which basically means don't touch that module, finish the upgrade process, and then I'll upgrade the module later.

**[04:35]** [04:35]
                                    If I had the forethought to download a newer version of that module, I could select upgrade here and simply pass in the MODL file. Or I could remove it, if I didn't want it anymore. I'm going to leave this as keep as is, and I'll hit next. It says it's ready to upgrade, so I'll click upgrade, and it'll run through the whole upgrade process. At this point, it's actually going to be restarting the Gateway, so you'll want to make sure that when you upgrade, you do it at an appropriate time. All right, and there we are, so the wizard finished. We're ready to start Ignition, so I'll go ahead and click finish here. And it should open up your browser, and it should take you to through a sort of simplified version of our commissioning process here. So if there's been any sort of changes to the end user license agreement, you'll see it up here. I'll go ahead and work my way through that. And we don't have to do the port stuff. We don't have to create an initial user.

**[05:27]** [05:27]
                                    All that stuff is taken from the previous configurations on the same Gateway. So it remembers your users and all your other projects. So let's start our Gateway. And again, I'll speed this part up so you don't have to wait for it. And here we are. Now, if you wanted to sort of verify that the installation process worked, go ahead and head over to the status section here. Go ahead and sign on in with whatever accounts you have. And again, on status and overview, you should see the version number has updated. And that's really all it takes to upgrade your Gateway. It's actually a pretty simple process and like I said earlier, as long as you take that Gateway backup, you're usually covered in most scenarios, if there's even a problem at all.

                                    There may come a time when you want to add a new module to your Ignition Gateway to get some new feature that you didn't have before or even update a module that you already have within your Gateway to get the latest fix from a newer module. Both of these things are really easy to do within the Ignition Gateway Webpage. First, we need to open up a web browser and come to our Gateway Webpage at localhost:8088. We then need to go to the configure section and log in with your user name and password. Once here in the Configure section, we're then going to go to the Modules page on the left hand side underneath the Systems section.

**[00:52]** [00:52]
                                    Here, we get a list of all of the modules that we have currently installed within our Gateway. Currently, there is a module that I don't have that I would like to add and that's the Alarm Notification module. To add a new module, I simply need to scroll down to the bottom of this page and click on the Install or Upgrade a Module... link at the bottom left. On this next page, we need to click on the choose file button in the upper left hand corner and choose the file for the module that we want to install. I've already downloaded a couple of module files from our website for us to experiment with. You'll notice that these module files have a special extension, .modl which stands for module.

                                    I'm going to select this module and then click on the open button in the lower right hand corner and then the install button. You may be taken to a page like this where you need to accept a new software Module License Agreement if there's a new version of it in this module. We simply need to click on the check box, I accept the terms in the license agreement in the lower left hand corner and then click on the accept license button just below that. The module might also have a new certificate. If it does, you'll be taken to a page that looks like this where you need to add the module certificate to your list of trusted certificates. To do so, simply click on the checkbox next to, I want to add this certificate to my trusted certificates and then click on the add certificate and install module button. As you can see, I now have a new module in my new module list, the Alarm Notification module. Now the version of the module that we just installed is version 5.0.0-beta0.

**[02:47]** [02:47]
                                    I just so happen to have a newer version of the module so let's take a look at what the upgrade process is for individual modules as well. It actually works in much the same way that we installed the original module. I simply scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on the install or upgrading module link. Again, I need to click on the choose file button and select the module file that I want to install. In this case, I'm going to select my newer Alarm Notification module and then click on the install button. You'll notice this time I didn't have to accept a license agreement or add a certificate to my list of trusted certificates. This is because the new module used the same license agreement and certificate as the older version of the module so I didn't need to go through that process again. However, because it is a newer version of the module, the version number for this module now reads 5.0.0-rc0 so I've now updated my module to the latest version.

                                    In this lesson we'll install ignition on Linux. Before we begin, you're going to want to head over to our website, that's inductiveautomation.com And you're going to want to go to the downloads page, there should be a button somewhere on our website. But of course the look of the site may change over time. Now in this video, I'm going to use the "installer.run" file. If we scroll down on our downloads page here, and we head over to our other operating systems, you get a full list of all the various installers that we have available. Now, for Linux, we do have a couple of options here. I'm using the top option here, but we also have the generic zip install files. Now the process for this is a little bit different than the one I'm going to show you here in the video. The zip file there does contain a README that will tell you what to do, but I won't be covering that in this video. Now, we also have this edge installer, which is sort of a focused or dedicated installer that can be used to install edge. It's not really necessary to install edge, you can actually use the middle option the generic zip to install edge maker or standard edition of ignition.

**[01:05]** [01:05]
                                    Now, to save you the time of watching me download this, I already have it in my downloads folder here. Now the first thing you're going to need to do, is to make sure that you can actually execute this RUN file as a program. Now in the desktop environment I'm using here, I can right click, go down to properties. And then if we switch over to permissions, we can see that currently under execute, this file is not allowed to execute as a program. So, we could click the little checkbox here to change that. But depending on your desktop environment, this part might be a little bit different. So, I'm going to close this here. And regardless, you can always open a terminal, and you can always use our friend change mode to make this executable. So I'll go ahead and type change mod, or C-H- M-O-D +x and then the name of the file which you can just start typing and then hit the Tab key to fill in the rest of the name. And just to give you a visual representation of what that did, I'm going to right click on Properties again go back to permissions. And you can see that execute has now been set. Now, at this point, you'll likely be able to double click the RUN file and run the installer.

**[02:02]** [02:02]
                                    But you can also use terminal as well, which I'll show you for this video. So, I'll switch over and I'll type period forward slash. And then I'll start typing the name of the file, and press tab to automatically fill in the rest. Now, I didn't have to here, but in some cases, you may need to type "sudo" first. You'll know if that's the case, because it will fail and tell you you need to run it as root. And at this point, the installer is going run some integrity testing and more or less get ready to run the wizard. Alright, so, we have the install wizard. I'll click next here to start with, and our first option is to select an installation location. This is useful if you're pretty peculiar about where you'd like to install ignition. However, I'm just going to leave it with the default and move on. So now we have to pick an installation type. So, you have typical or custom. This choice determines which modules will install initially. We'll talk about modules later, but each module provides a set of features to ignition. The typical option here, will automatically install our most popular modules.

[03:04]** [03:04]
                                    While custom allows you to pick which modules to install. Custom also allows you to pass in any third party modules you may want to add right now. You can always add and remove modules after the installation process, so, no need to fret the choice now. I'm going to leave Typical selected and click Next. Alright, we're ready to install. So, click the Install button, and I'm going to speed this part up here, so you don't have to wait for me. And there we are. So, we reached the end of the install wizard and we have two checkboxes. Start ignition now, means just what it says, start the ignition gateway right now, which allows you to start building a project. Install service will install ignition as a service, allowing you to interact with it like you would any other service on the operating system. I'm going to leave both of these with the defaults and click Finish. So, clicking finish here exits the install wizard and takes us to the next part, which is something we call system commissioning. Which is basically some additional configuration we make, before we can really dig in. Commissioning is always done through a web browser. So, you'll probably see a web browser in a new tab appear here.

**[04:06]** [04:06]
                                    And it will give you this addition selection here. Now, we have some videos and other documentation that talks about the various additions here. If you're just starting out, and you don't know which one to pick, I'd highly recommend you pick the center option, which is standard ignition. The other two options, maker and edge, work off as the same core features and functionality as standard edition, but there are some certain features that are missing from them. So, if you're trying to work your way through Inductive University here, it might be a good idea to pick the Standard Edition. We have an end user licensing agreement you get to work through, if you accept, select the appropriate radio button and click Next. On this page, we need you to create an initial user. This is a starting user that allows you to access your new ignition system initially. Later on, you can add new users and even change the configurations on this one. So for now, just type some credentials you'll remember and move on to the next step. And yes, we do make fun of you for using a weak password. Next is the HTTP configuration.

**[05:03]** [05:03]
                                    So, ignition uses a couple of ports, to handle some communication. You can see if you look at the URL in my web browser here, we're already using 8088 to access this page here, so, if you wanted to change the ports, now's a good time to do it. But this is also something you can change later, if you need to. So, we'll press finish setup. And I'll click the Start gateway button. So, we installed ignition, we did some commissioning. And now we can actually start up the gateway which is sort of the main server side piece of ignition. I'll go ahead and speed this part up here too, so you don't have to wait. And here we are, we're all finished installing ignition. What you're looking at here, is the gateways web interface, which allows you to further modify your ignition system. You may want to bookmark this page in your web browser for easy access later. If you're looking for the next step, I'd recommend taking a look at the designer launcher lesson, which shows you how to get designer access and start building a project.

**[00:00]** [00:00]
                                    In this lesson we'll take a look at installing Ignition on Mac OS. So first thing you're going to want to do is, head over to our website, inductiveautomation.com, go to our downloads page and grab the installer DMG for OSX which you can see I have right here. You'll want to double click on the dmg to mount it and then you should see the contents in there. From here we can find the application inside, then we can either double click on the application to run the install wizard or we can control + click and select open. Now this does require administrator privileges to install so go ahead and type in your password there. And you should see the install wizard appear. I'll hit next to begin. Now the first choice you have to make is where do you want to install this. We do have a suggested default location but of course you can change that if you feel the need to. I'm going to leave that right there and hit Next. Next you'll need to select an installation type.

**[01:01]** [01:01]
                                    If you're new to Ignition, I'd recommend you select Typical. The Typical option installs our most commonly used modules leaving out some of the less common specialty modules. Modules if you're unfamiliar provides some of the larger feature sets within Ignition. The custom option allows you to pick which modules to install, as well as provide an opportunity to upload third party modules during the installation process. In either case, you can always add and remove modules after the installation process so no need to worry too much about this decision right now. I'll select Typical. Alright and we're ready to install. So I'll press the Install button. And I'll use the power of editing to speed this part up so you don't have to wait for the whole thing. And with that we're at the end of the install wizard. We do have some checkboxes here. The Start Ignition Now checkbox will attempt to start Ignition once we click Finish, which leads us into the commissioning process. The Install Service checkbox will mark Ignition as a service on the local Operating System. I'm going to leave both of these checked and click Finish.

**[02:06]** [02:06]
                                    Next you're going to notice a browser open which is going to take us to phase two which is something we call system commissioning. Now the first step of commissioning is selecting an addition. We do have three. We have Maker, Edge and Standard. Standard being the center option there. If you're uncertain of which one to install, I would recommend installing the Standard edition. Both Maker and Edge are built off of Standard Ignition but there are some features they just don't have. So if you're trying to work your way through all of Inductive University here, some of the challenges will require Standard Ignition. So I'll select the Standard option. Next we have an End User License Agreement. Go ahead and work your way through that. If you accept select the I have read and agree with the terms and conditions and click Next. Next, you'll need to create an initial user. This user account is how you'll access this Ignition installation and do things like build a project. You can always add new users later as well as change the password on this user but for right now, go ahead and type in some credentials you'll remember. And yes we do make fun of you for using a very weak password. Go ahead and click Next.

**[03:09]** [03:09]
                                    Next would be the HTTP configuration. Ignition uses a lot of ports for communicating with different things. This allows you to pick certain ports for those types of communications. You can always change these later. So I'm not going to worry about this too much. I'm just going to use the defaults. I'll click Finish setup, and then I'll click Start Gateway. And I'll speed this part up too so you don't have to wait. Now Safari is giving me a prompt asking me to remember the password I typed in earlier. I'm going to click Not Now and with that we've arrived. You're looking at what we call the Gateway's web interface, which allows you to make a bunch of high level changes to your system. If you check the address bar, you'll see we're at localhost or the system's local IP address on port 808 which is one of those HTTP ports we saw earlier. You may want to bookmark this page in your browser so you can easily return here later. And with that congratulations you now have Ignition running on your system. If you're ready to dive in now would be a good time to take a look at the designer launcher video here on Inductive University which gets you closer to building a project.
